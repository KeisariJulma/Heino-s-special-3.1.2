It is highly unlikely, to say the least, that this is their only food source, but intake of other nutrients has yet to be observed.\n\nThey will rarely, if ever, attack, even when provoked.

Their bones were prone to fossilize rather than decay, and their very existence exhausted the fragile ecosystem they inhabited, leaving it permanently transformed in the wake of their passing."
 country.1145.desc:0 "The cracks in the planetoid's crust, first presumed to be the result of significant tectonic activity, are actually the lasting marks of impossibly large roots, burrowing through the earth.\n\nAt some point in the distant past, a freak mutation - possibly deliberately induced by sapient beings, though it is unlikely they could have predicted the result - caused the native plant life to grow out of control. Many of these plants reproduce through pollination, with countless gametes carried by currents through the lower atmosphere. While this process was originally only cause for mild irritation, the exponential increase in atmosphere-borne particles effectively choked the life out of all animals on the surface in a matter of months."
