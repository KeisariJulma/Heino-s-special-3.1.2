 anomaly.186.desc.v1:0 "The vault is a tomb for hopeful immortals.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] asserts that the huge blocks of ternary code found in the databanks are neural images - digitized brain scans. Doubtless the aliens of [From.From.GetName] considered this their only shot at any kind of survival, following whatever calamity befell their [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. They did not have the means to resurrect themselves, but banked on the impossibly small hope that eventually, someone else would have those means."

Doubtless the aliens of [From.From.GetName] considered this their only shot at survival, following whatever calamity befell their [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]. Lacking the means to resurrect themselves, they banked on the small hope that eventually, someone else would.\n\nWith our expertise in the field of robotics, we could upload the brain scans to robot shells - however it seems uncertain whether the robots are sophisticated enough to support a higher intelligence."
