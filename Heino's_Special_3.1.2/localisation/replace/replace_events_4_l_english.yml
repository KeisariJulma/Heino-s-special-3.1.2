 colony.3020.a:0 "No, §HI§! am [Root.Owner.Leader.GetName]! Who are you?!"
 colony.3021.desc:0 "Fascinating. If what you say is true, I think this portal bridges the gap between alternate dimensions. We are both [Root.Owner.Leader.GetName], but at some point an event must have caused our respective dimensions to diverge."

 hollow_planet_category_desc:1 "Preliminary scans have shown that [Root.GetName] appears to be merely a hollow shell. We speculate that it may either be an entirely artificial creation, or it may once have been a normal [Root.GetPlanetMoon] which was somehow hollowed out."
 anomaly.6003.desc:1 "Much to our surprise, [From.GetName] appears to have begun life as a normal [From.GetPlanetMoon], but it has at some point been entirely hollowed out using an unknown mining technique which has left [From.GetName] a mere empty shell."
 anomaly.6004.desc:0 "Initial scanning revealed little but that [From.GetName] has an unusually strong magnetic field surrounding it. This interfered with detailed scans until the [Root.GetName] moved in for a closer look. The field seems to be caused by the high density of metallic ores found in the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust, which will likely be a boon to local mining endeavors."
 anomaly.6007.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an abundance of easily accessible minerals in this [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust, which should make mining here a lucrative business."
 anomaly.6016.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an unusually large amount of natural satellites. Hundreds of small moons and moonlets orbit the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon], many possessing valuable mineral deposits."
 anomaly.6019.desc:0 "[From.From.GetName] has an unusually low density, and therefore much lower gravity than most [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]s of comparable size."
 anomaly.6025.desc:0 "Perhaps [From.From.GetName] once had a moon which was destroyed in some calamity, or perhaps its orbital debris never fully coalesced in the first place. Whatever the cause, this [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] is surrounded by a belt of small asteroids."
 anomaly.6026.desc:0 "The scenery of [From.From.GetName] is simply beautiful. Anyone living on this [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] will be constantly finding new wonders to behold."
 anomaly.6660.desc.gravity:0 "$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The gravity on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] is far from ideal to accommodate our potential settlers.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$"
 anomaly.6660.desc.gravity_mach:0 "$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ Though the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s gravity is far from ideal to accommodate organic settlers, our superior gravity calibration algorithms will negate its effects.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$"
 anomaly.6660.desc.gravity_desc_mach:0 "$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ Though the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s gravity is far from ideal to accommodate organic settlers, our superior gravity calibration algorithms will negate its effects.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$"
 anomaly.6660.desc.wildlife:0 "$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ Animals found on this [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] seem hostile, and will make it harder to colonize.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$"
 anomaly.6660.desc.titan:0 "$anomaly.6660.desc.start$ The [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] is host to massive lifeforms that might be dangerous to interact with.\n\n$anomaly.6660.desc.end$"
 anomaly.6660.desc.end:0 "We will surely come across even more irregularities like this as we survey new planets and moons, and should not underestimate their impact on our expansion."
 colony_mod.7.desc:1 "After a thorough investigation, we have come to the conclusion that [Root.GetName] was a casualty in some forgotten war. Who lived here and who they fought is unknown, but it is clear that they were wiped out following an extrasolar invasion force entering the system and the ensuing battle for the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. While this is a chilling realization, we can at least be reasonably sure that it is unlikely to happen again."
 colony_mod.14.desc:1 "While an asteroid falling on your [Root.GetPlanetMoon] can be nerve-wracking, [Root.GetName] has been rather fortunate. No harm has befallen the colony."
 colony_mod.100.name:0 "[From.GetPlanetMoonCap] of the Titans"
 colony_mod.100.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is home to Titanic Life, some of which are so numerous and dangerous that they render some areas of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] inhospitable for any species."
 colony_mod.18.desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is the site of a self-organizing quantum computer of astounding complexity and subtly. The patterns of the weather, the native life, even our own colony is incorporated into it and somehow used as neurons in a [Root.GetPlanetMoon]-sized network. We do not understand how this is possible, and we have no way of controlling it, but we do know that if we arrange our computers in a certain way [Root.GetName] will enhance their performance."
 colony.3009.desc:0 "Strangely, the Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] seems to connect to a [Root.GetPlanetMoon] which looks very much like [Root.GetName]. Stranger still, there's a signal being broadcast to us through it..."
 colony.3020.desc:0 "This is [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle] [Root.Owner.Leader.GetName] of the [Root.Owner.GetName]. Who are you, portal-aliens?"
 colony.3022.desc:0 "Much the same as it fares in your dimension, I expect. We have spread out through space from [Root.Owner.home_planet.GetName] since the discovery of the warp drive-"
 colony.3022.a:0 "The warp drive? We travel by hyperlanes."
 colony.3024.desc:0 "The Warp beasts assail every known civilization. They are a threat to all life. As far as we have determined, once warp travel reached a certain critical level in the galaxy, the Warp beasts awoke and attacked. Several species we know of have already fallen, but so far we are holding them off."
