Some speculate that the shattered planetary remnants found beneath one of our stations is the lost homeworld of our species, but the truth may never be known.\n\nIt has only been a few centuries since spaceflight allowing travel between our three stations was invented - or rediscovered, depending on who you ask.

So great was their horror at this utopian pacifism that they resolved the Shallarians must be wiped from the face of the galaxy. Since their victims had no military, the ensuing war was as short as it was brutal. When the deed was done, the [fanatic_xenophobe_fe.GetSpeciesNamePlural] left behind an automated guardian to ensure that no survivors could return and thus revive the civilization they so hated.\n\nIn addition to these records, [Root.Leader.GetName] found a data core explaining Shallarian terraforming methods. Their technology in this field is far superior to our own, so this knowledge will surely benefit our empire."

The situation on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] has grown dire, as medics have increasingly been forced to use heavy sedatives on the dancers to stop them from dancing themselves to death.\n\nIt appears that the culprit is a gas released by the local vegetation, which induces feelings of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, while suppressing feelings of exhaustion, overriding [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] self-preservation instincts.\n\nFortunately, our scientists have developed a synthetic gas that - once released into the air - will neutralize the effects of the 'dancing gas'. Furthermore, it seems that the 'dancing gas' has certain valuable properties we can make use of, if we can extract it from the plants before it is released into the air."
 federations2.14.desc:0 "Although our scientists are still baffled by the cause of the so-called Dancing Plague, it does not seem to pose a danger to our colonists. While those affected by it experience a feeling of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, their survival instinct means that exhaustion forces them to rest sooner or later. Furthermore, it seems that only some areas are significantly affected by this phenomenon.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs have already begun designating these areas as party zones, advertising [Root.GetName] as the '[Root.GetPlanetMoonCap] of Eternal Festivity', where young and old alike may come to release their shackles and enjoy themselves."
