 akx.9001.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the signal was unexpectedly easy to decipher... but [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team has spent considerable time confirming that it's not a hoax.\n\nIt is a repeating, half-coherent message in the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] language - something like a poem. It repeats the phrases §HGRAVITY IS DESIRE§! and §HTIME IS SIGHT§!. It encodes co-ordinates near the black hole. And it ends with a dedication §Gby name§! to the Science Officer - who adds dispassionately that [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team has confirmed that the signal has been radiating into interstellar space since before [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] birth. In fact, the signal may predate our civilization."

 akx.9010.desc:0 "The black hole in [horizonsignal_system.GetName] is active again. Once again, a looping signal flickers in the darkness at the edge of normal space. But this time, there's an acoustic message encoded in the signal.

Then the same co-ordinates as the first signal, the co-ordinates where [horizonsignal_firstleader.GetSheHe] disappeared - what the media has christened "the Exit Point."

 akx.9400.desc:0 "Our observation station on [coils_planet.GetName] reports the rise of an unusual minority religious-artistic movement, the Coils of God. Primitive mechanical clocks are considered holy, but ritually destroyed after a year's operation. The [coils_planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s worm- and serpent-analogues are protected from harm. Time, the Coils-priests say, is a labyrinth. "What was, will be; what will be, was" they intone in their prayers."
 akx.9450.desc:0 "The Coils of God cult on [coils_planet.GetName] has grown with unusual speed. It can be found in every city on the [coils_planet.GetPlanetMoon], and it's fostering a series of lengthy ceremonies conducted by citizens in every walk of life.
