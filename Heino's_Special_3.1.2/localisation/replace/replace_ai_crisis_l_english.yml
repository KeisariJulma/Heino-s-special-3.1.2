 crisis.2030.name:0 "$pc_ai$"
 crisis.2030.desc:0 "A massive energy spike has been reported in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system! The entire surface of one of the system's barren worlds has come apart, revealing some kind of planet-wide factory.\n\nVast fleets of strange AI-controlled vessels are emerging from beneath the surface of this §H$pc_ai$§! in search of targets to attack."
 crisis.2031.name:0 "Second $pc_ai$"
 crisis.2031.desc:0 "We have detected yet another massive energy spike, this time coming from the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system! After rapidly cooling through some kind of artificial means, a molten planet in the system cracked open to reveal an immense planetary factory.\n\nEven now, the $pc_ai$ is spewing forth vast fleets of AI-controlled warships."
 crisis.2032.name:0 "Third $pc_ai$"
 crisis.2032.desc:0 "We have identified what must be a third $pc_ai$ in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. A local gas giant spontaneously ignited, burning with the intensity of a small sun for close to a standard day.\n\nThe planet then rapidly cooled, revealing its metal core - complete with the same planet-wide factories that have been witnessed on other $pc_ai$s. Huge AI-controlled defensive fleets have already taken up positions in orbit."
 crisis.2033.name:0 "Fourth $pc_ai$"
 crisis.2033.desc:0 "A fourth $pc_ai$ is now active in the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system. The sixth planet of the system, which was previously covered in toxic fumes, somehow expunged its dense atmosphere in a matter of days. When this process was over, the planet's surface parted to reveal an immense, planet-wide factory complex.\n\nAncient fleets of AI-controlled warships are now emerging from underground hangars to continue the crusade against the entirety of organic civilization."
 crisis.2036.desc:0 "With the destruction of all four $pc_ai$s, scientists have managed to deduce the origin point of the Ghost Signal. It is coming from §HCX-9881§!, a previously uncharted star system on the galactic periphery.\n\nThis has to be where all the Synthetics that fell under the sway of the signal journeyed. The Contingency will remain a threat until this final system has been dealt with."
 crisis.2036.desc.b:0 "With the destruction of all four $pc_ai$s, we have deduced the origin point of the Ghost Signal. It is coming from §HCX-9881§!, a previously uncharted star system on the galactic periphery.\n\nThis has to be where all the corrupted Synthetics went. The Contingency will remain a threat until this final system has been dealt with."
 crisis.2037.name:0 "$pc_ai$ Destroyed"
 crisis.2037.desc:0 "§H[From.GetName]§!, the $pc_ai$ in the [From.solar_system.GetName] system, has been destroyed. After being subjected to heavy orbital bombardment, the planet's AI Core self-destructed to prevent capture by triggering a massive anti-matter device hidden deep beneath the surface.\n\nWith the destruction of this planet, the Ghost Signal has lost an important relay station and its strength has waned considerably as a result.\n\nIn addition, the explosion on the planet has spread large deposits of "§HLiving Metal§!" across its surface. This strange material has several unique properties, and it is used by the Contingency in the construction of all of its warforms and factories."
 crisis.2037.desc.b:0 "§H[From.GetName]§!, the hostile $pc_ai$ in the [From.solar_system.GetName] system, has been destroyed. After being subjected to heavy orbital bombardment, the planet's AI Core self-destructed to prevent capture, by triggering a massive anti-matter device hidden deep beneath the surface.\n\nWith the destruction of this planet, the Ghost Signal has lost an important relay station and its strength has waned considerably as a result.\n\nIn addition, the explosion on the planet has spread large deposits of "§HLiving Metal§!" across its surface.

 crisis.2037.alt.desc.pt1:0 "Another $pc_ai$ has been destroyed! §H[From.GetName]§! in the [From.solar_system.GetName] system exploded after the planet's defenses were decimated in battle. As before, the AI Core triggered a self-destruct mechanism to prevent its capture."
 crisis.2037.alt.cracked.desc:0 "§H[From.GetName]§!, the $pc_ai$ in the [From.solar_system.GetName] system, has been subjected to the immense power of a Colossus world cracker beam. The weapon sliced through the planet's heavily armored surface with ease, detonating its core and vaporizing the Contingency's subterranean war factories.\n\nWith the destruction of this planet, the Ghost Signal has lost an important relay station and its strength has waned considerably as a result."
 crisis.2037.alt.shielded.desc:0 "§H[From.GetName]§!, the $pc_ai$ in the [From.solar_system.GetName] system, has been encased within an impenetrable energy shield by a Colossus. Permanently cut off from the rest of the Contingency, the planet's AI Core appears to have gone dormant. It will no longer be a threat.\n\nWith the neutralization of this planet, the Ghost Signal has lost an important relay station and its strength has waned considerably as a result."
 crisis.2037.alt.godray.desc:0 "§H[From.GetName]§!, the $pc_ai$ in the [From.solar_system.GetName] system, has been neutralized. After being subjected to divine light by a Colossus, the planet's AI Core self-destructed before its final systems failed, using a massive anti-matter device hidden deep beneath the surface. It will no longer be a threat.\n\nWith the neutralization of this planet, the Ghost Signal has lost an important relay station and its strength has waned considerably as a result."
 crisis.2038.desc:0 "The Contingency has failed. With the destruction of the last $pc_ai$, the galaxy no longer faces the threat of systematic mass extinction. All surviving Contingency warforms have either powered down or self-destructed, and the Ghost Signal is no longer being transmitted.\n\nAs with the other $pc_ai$s, the main nexus detonated itself in a massive anti-matter explosion when it became apparent that it could no longer resist its attackers. Traveling outwards at lightspeed, the intense light from the energy discharge will be visible to future generations for millennia to come as a bright, short-lived star.\n\nAcross the galaxy, sapient beings are united in their celebration of this great victory. For the moment, at least, the future looks bright."
 crisis.2038.cracker.desc:0 "The Contingency has failed. With the destruction of the last $pc_ai$, the galaxy no longer faces the threat of systematic mass extinction. All surviving Contingency warforms have either powered down or self-destructed, and the Ghost Signal is no longer being transmitted.\n\nThe main nexus was vaporized by a world cracker beam from a Colossus, which shattered the entire planet. Traveling outwards at lightspeed, the intense light from the energy discharge will be visible to future generations for millennia to come as a bright, short-lived star.\n\nAcross the galaxy, sapient beings are united in their celebration of this great victory.

 crisis.2038.shield.desc:0 "The Contingency has failed. With the neutralization of the last $pc_ai$, the galaxy no longer faces the threat of systematic mass extinction. All surviving Contingency warforms have either powered down or self-destructed, and the Ghost Signal is no longer being transmitted.\n\nEncased within an impenetrable energy shield by a Colossus, the main nexus can no longer influence outside events. For the sake of future generations, we can only hope that the shield will hold... but for now, at least, the shielded planet will serve as a monument to the Contingency's downfall.\n\nAcross the galaxy, sapient beings are united in their celebration of this great victory. For the moment, at least, the future looks bright."

All surviving Contingency warforms have either powered down or self-destructed, and the Ghost Signal is no longer being transmitted.\n\nThe main nexus was exposed to a divine enforcer beam from a Colossus, which triggered a self-destruction mechanism from the AI Core. Traveling outwards at lightspeed, the intense light from the energy discharge will be visible to future generations for millennia to come as a bright, short-lived star.\n\nAcross the galaxy, sapient beings are united in their celebration of this great victory.
