 COLD_RESEARCH_CAT:0 "Cold, Hard Potential"
 
 DES_BURIED_DESC:0 "The desert [Root.GetPlanetMoon] [Root.GetName] seems to conceal some buried secrets."
 CON_BIOLOGY_DESC:0 "The forests on this [Root.GetPlanetMoon] bear promises of interesting finds."
 TOX_PLANET_DESC:0 "There appears to be deliberately-crafted structures on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, pointing toward a past long forgotten."
 anomaly.4000.desc:0 "It appears that some of [From.GetName]'s flora has developed effective defense mechanisms through natural selection. Numerous trees and fungi exude spores that act like a powerful acidic on non-plant organisms. Thankfully Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has found a way to counteract some strands of these spores, making the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s forests less threatening to us!"
 anomaly.4049.desc:0 "Suspicious that the crew is hiding something, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] decided to mount an unauthorized solo-expedition to examine the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s core. A video feed from the ship's submarine shows what happened:\n\nGoing deep into the oceans of [From.From.GetName] there is only darkness, but also something... alive. Inside deep-sea caverns close to the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s warm core there are webs of plankton-like vegetation, that spans the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s entire crust.\n\nWhile investigating the plankton [Root.GetLeaderName] is stricken with a seizure, only to awake hours later.\n\nAfter returning to the [Root.GetName] the Science Officer is delusional and only speaks of horrors and haunted dreams."
 anomaly.4055.desc:0 "After the study of [From.GetName] has concluded, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that they have found the [From.GetPlanetMoon] to be unusually rich in minerals. This discovery was made possible in large part thanks to a certain member of the [Root.GetName] crew. [Root.GetLeaderName] praises the protégé highly."
 anomaly.4100.desc:0 "$anomaly.4100.base.desc$ The dark scales of the creatures are rock hard, and they are very skittish when approached.\n\nIt might be possible to domesticate the beasts and have them assist in potential future colonization of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. However, we might however happen across some interesting revelations by studying them first."
 anomaly.4100.expert.desc:0 "$anomaly.4100.base.desc$\n\n[Root.GetLeaderName] have been able to deduce that the animals have some sort of psionic ability, as changes in their demeanor indicates that they are able to intuitively sense our intentions.\n\nIt might be possible to domesticate the beasts and have them assist in potential future colonization of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. However, we might however happen across some interesting revelations by studying them first.\n\n[Root.GetLeaderName] claims that the indigenous creatures seem to "respond negatively to thoughts that indicate any sort of threat.""
 anomaly.4105.desc:0 "The [From.GetPlanetMoon] [From.GetName] is a toxic wasteland, but our scans unveil that it has not always been so. A now extinct civilization seems to have destroyed its home planet, via a heavy reliance on climate altering fuels and toxins.\n\nOn a remote hill, close to a major city, we have found a lone active facility. A robot assembly plant, desolated and surrounded by military vehicles, so deteriorated they break upon touch.\n\nThe facility is alien and mysterious, but could provide us with ample study material."

 anomaly.4125.desc:1 "We have found an old mining station around the [From.GetPlanetMoon] [From.GetName], drifting in orbit. It was surely used to mine the [From.GetPlanetMoon] of its resources, but by whom remains a mystery.\n\nThe technology within the station is very close to our own. We should be able to take hold of the station and have it up and running in no time. Or we could always scrap it for parts."
 anomaly.4135.desc:1 "On [From.GetName] the crew of the [Root.GetName] have found something extraordinary. The [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s dunes have hid several ruins, belonging to an interstellar civilization of settlers. The settlements have long been destroyed by the ravages of time.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] is quick to discover a stored cache of valuables and documents. The collection of texts must have been most revered by the settlers, as they were stored amongst other valuables."
 anomaly.4145.base.desc:0 "On [From.GetName], the nuclear winter is far from over. Nothing alive remains on any part of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] reports the team's findings: Everything points towards a civil war having broken out within a previously unified civilization.\n\nThe root cause of the war was most likely the conflict between different stewards who all wanted control over larger parts of the union's slaves."
 anomaly.4157.b:0 "Your [WarriorHomePlanet.GetPlanetMoon] was ruined by the war. Only you remain."
 anomaly.4158.xenophobe.f:0 "You are of no use to us. Leave our world!"
 anomaly.4170.b:0 "Exploiting the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is not a long-term solution."
 colony.2005.desc:0 "The colonists on [Root.GetName] regularly explore the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] in hopes of finding more resources to help with day-to-day life. A recent expedition to the north pole has now unveiled a large object on the bottom of the ocean: An alien battle cruiser.\n\nThe pressure of the deep will prove a challenge, but it is possible to get to the ship."
