 crisis.4150.desc:1 "The years go by, and yet the fire within each [Root.GetSpeciesName] burns with unshakable determination. Our dominion is expanding and so is the magnitude of our efforts.\n\nAs we encounter other empires we only have to give them two options: unconditional allegiance or complete annihilation. That is, if they are given an option at all.\n\nOne way or the other, the [Root.GetName] keeps growing."
 crisis.4155.desc:2 "A great change is coming. The [Root.GetName] is on the verge of realizing our supreme goal. Each and every [Root.GetSpeciesName] feels it with every fiber of their being - our destiny is at hand.\n\nOur experience - nay, our very history - of forceful expansion still rewards us with new ways to subjugate our enemies and usurp control of a galaxy in turmoil.\n\nSurely those who dare stand against us must see the futility of their whimpering efforts."
 espionage.1050.desc:1 "A particularly observant operative in the §Y[finderskeepers_country.GetName]§! has laid their [root.species.GetHandNamePlural] on part of a §H[finderskeepers_country.GetAdj] encryption key§!. It would seem a careless [finderskeepers_country.GetAdj] $job_administrator$ mislaid the device whilst commuting.\n\nThis bodes well enough for our operations in the [finderskeepers_country.GetName], but our study of the device's unique design has revealed novel insights for our general approach to §Y$MOD_INTEL_DECRYPTION_ADD$§!."
 espionage.1081.desc.outro:0 "Quite how this information came to be known by the [insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetName] is unclear. Our own operatives' efforts to tail suspected [insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetAdj] intelligence operatives seem to have paid off, though. If this intelligence is genuine, the [insidious_plot_spynetwork.GetSpeciesNamePlural] may just have done the hard work of gathering it for us."
 operation.1026.desc.goods.smooth:1 "$operation.1026.desc.intro$\n\nA single operative hid within the §Hgoods entrance§! of a remote research facility, waiting to be couriered past a number of clearly-inadequate [fromfrom.target.GetAdj] security measures. An unwitting [fromfrom.target.GetSpeciesName] has placed our operative within easy reach of a terminal for the [fromfrom.target.GetName] central repository.\n\n$operation.2016.desc.outro.smooth$"
 operation.1026.desc.invited.smooth:1 "$operation.1026.desc.intro.smooth$ Our operative's cover held throughout, and although the [fromfrom.target.GetSpeciesNamePlural] exercised reasonable security, the §Htrust we manufactured§! was just sufficient to grant us our window of opportunity.\n\n$operation.2016.desc.outro.smooth$"
 operation.5016.desc:1 "We have lost all contact with our operatives assigned to §HOperation [fromfrom.GetName]§! in the §Y[fromfrom.target.GetName]§!. Whether by our target's cunning design, or simply an unlucky coincidence for us, [fromfrom.target.GetAdj] shielding technology has proven a worthy adversary us.\n\nIt is possible the [fromfrom.target.GetName] may gain from this incident. Although our operative drones may operate semi-autonomously, without our presence they are still far more vulnerable to enemy capture."
 custodian.2.b.desc:1 "The Galactic Senate has voted to bestow emergency Custodianship powers upon the §H[custodian.GetName]§!. In a ceremony broadcast across the galaxy, they were appointed the official §HCustodians of the Galactic Community§!.\n\nAs the first among equals, the [custodian.GetAdj] government is now charged with safeguarding the Galactic Community from all potential threats, be they internal or external, who would seek it harm. They have been granted vast powers in all Community matters and can now propose special resolutions."
 emperor.3.intro.desc:0 "It is the dawn of a New Order. The old Galactic Community has been dismantled, and in its place the §H[Root.GetGalEmpireName]§! has risen. After claiming the throne of this new pan galactic state, the former §H[gal_emperor.GetSpeciesAdj]§! Custodians now refer to themselves as the §H[gal_emperor.GetName]§!."
 emperor.52.desc:1 "All references to the old Galactic Community are being swept away in the new Imperium, and as part of this reorganization, the Galactic Defense Force has changed its name to the §HImperial Armada§!.\n\nThis new fleet has inherited much of its rank structure and organization from the GDF, but new uniforms and insignia have been introduced, and all serving members are required to swear an oath of allegiance to the [gal_emperor.GetRulerTitle].\n\nWhile the Armada's ship crews and support personnel are still recruited from all members of the Imperium, the percentage of [gal_emperor.GetSpeciesAdj] officers has dramatically increased."
 emperor.310.desc:0 "With Imperial resistance crumbling, our §H[new_emperor.GetSpeciesAdj]§! allies have seized the throne and proclaimed themselves the rulers of the §H[new_emperor.GetGalEmpireName]§!. Victory is ours!"
 CUSTODIAN_TO_COMMUNITY_MEMBER_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "As Custodians, we have vowed to put an end to [From.GetAdj] schemes in the Community."
 CUSTODIAN_TO_COMMUNITY_MEMBER_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It will take time to reform the Community into something better, but with the help of our [From.GetAdj] friends, it can be done."
 crisis.4100.1:0 "As Galactic Custodians, the [custodian.GetName] has called upon all Community members to mobilize their fleets and launch a concerted attack on the [new_crisis.GetName]: "The galaxy will not know peace until the [new_crisis.GetAdj] menace has been dealt with once and for all.""
 crisis.4100.2:0 "Representatives from the Senate have called upon all Community members to mobilize their fleets and launch a concerted attack on the [new_crisis.GetName], declaring that "the galaxy will not know peace until the [new_crisis.GetAdj] menace has been dealt with once and for all.""
 crisis.4101.desc:1 "The Imperial Senate has passed a resolution declaring the §H[new_crisis.GetName]§! a threat to all sapient life and a crisis of galactic proportions. As a consequence, the [new_crisis.GetName] finds itself in a state of war with the entirety of the Imperium.\n\nIn a public announcement transmitted from [gal_emperor.Capital.GetName], the [gal_emperor.GetRulerTitle] called upon all members of the Imperium to mobilize their fleets and launch a concerted attack on the [new_crisis.GetName]: "The galaxy and the Imperium will not know peace until the [new_crisis.GetAdj] menace has been dealt with once and for all.""
 crisis.6181.desc:0 "The entire §H[destroyed_system.GetName]§! system has been destroyed! A massive starship belonging to the §H[crisis_country.GetName]§! took up position above the primary star and somehow triggered what can only be described as a supernova, which utterly devastated the rest of the system. The star then collapsed into a black hole.\n\nOnly the [crisis_country.GetAdj] starship, which they apparently refer to as a "§HStar-Eater§!," survived the cataclysm. Evidently, the [crisis_country.GetName] now possesses both the technology and the means to destroy entire star systems."
 war_in_heaven.7.desc:1 "Ever since the awakening of the §H[FirstSleeper.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! and their ancient §H[From.GetSpeciesAdj]§! rivals, the two giants have been at odds, skirmishing and jockeying for influence, probing each others' might. This has resulted in a series of increasingly terse confrontations, finally erupting in an open battle between a [FirstSleeper.GetSpeciesAdj] fleet and their [From.GetSpeciesAdj] counterparts in a remote system. The conflict has now escalated into full-blown war between the §H[FirstSleeper.GetName]§! and the §H[From.GetName]§!.\n\nBoth sides are demanding the immediate dissolution of the §HGalactic Imperium§! and for its individual members to pick a side in the war. Earlier today, the [gal_emperor.GetRulerTitle] addressed the Imperial Senate and categorically rejected their demands. The galaxy now finds itself in a massive three-way war on a scale never before witnessed."
 operation.6010.4.desc:0 "§H[operation_target.GetName]§!, a [agent_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] agent of the Imperial Security Directorate, is particularly apt at [operation_target.GetHerHis] job. [operation_target.GetSheHeCap] [operation_target.GetIsAre] personally responsible for the arrest of hundreds of "dissidents" - several of whom were working for us. It is time for this ISD agent's illustrious career to come to a premature and very permanent end."
 operation.6201.1.desc:0 "We have made contact with a rowdy but promising group of [target.GetSpeciesAdj] pirates. These violent cutthroats are more than willing to accept our weapons and ships, although we'll have no way of controlling them once they're set loose."
 operation.6205.3.desc:0 "The [target_country.GetSpeciesAdj] drone mutants that we supplied with ships and weapons have established themselves in the §H[privateer_system.GetName]§! system. From there they are preying on everything within their reach in their struggle for resources and nutrients. Our analysts expect that the central hive consciousness of the §H[target_country.GetName]§! will soon have to divert forces to deal with this destabilizing threat within its borders."
 operation.6252.1.desc:0 "Through their surveillance efforts, our operatives have managed to obtain sensitive information regarding a certain high-ranking [target.GetAdj] government official. If it were to be released to the general public, this information would prove very embarrassing.\n\nWe are ready to discreetly approach this official to see if some sort of alternate arrangement can be worked out."
 operation.6252.2.desc:0 "One of our operatives has secured an old data file containing [target.GetAdj] invasion plans for several foreign powers. Although the plans are obsolete and seem to have been entirely hypothetical, there are several detailed scenarios that involve the arrest or execution of the target empire's political leadership.\n\nAs the release of these plans could potentially be embarrassing for the §H[target.GetName]§!, our operatives are ready to approach their government to work out a deal."
 operation.6252.3.desc:0 "We have learned that a certain high-level [target.GetAdj] government official has been secretly siphoning off a small amount of credits from their defense budget for personal use. If this information were to become public knowledge in the §H[target.GetName]§!, it would cause quite a scandal.\n\nOur operatives are ready to discreetly approach this official to see if some sort of arrangement can be worked out..."
 operation.6252.4.desc:0 "Our surveillance efforts have revealed that a high-ranking [target.GetAdj] diplomat is engaged in an affair with a [scandal_species.GetSpeciesAdj] embassy staff member. The exact details of this relationship elude us, but its mere existence would be highly embarrassing to both the diplomat and their government if it were shared with the general public.\n\nWe have operatives standing ready to approach the diplomat in a discreet attempt to reach an agreement."
 operation.6252.5.desc:0 "Our operatives have obtained evidence that a distinguished member of the [target.GetAdj] government has ties to a pirate organization active within their borders. From what we can tell, this official has been feeding these pirates sensitive information about internal trade routes.\n\nIf we were to keep this evidence to ourselves, the government official would likely be very grateful..."
