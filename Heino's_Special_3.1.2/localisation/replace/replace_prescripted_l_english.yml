 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying 2,500 colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Oort Cloud - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again, and the destabilized wormhole vanished.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships survived the passage and established a flourishing colony on a lush alien moon. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_blorg_desc:0 "In the distant past, the Blorg lived alone and nameless in the jungles that cover much of their homeworld. One day they picked up radio transmissions from a star far away. What they heard shocked them: the sounds of friends, movies, culture and music - things the Blorg had done without for eons.\n\nFinally understanding what they had been missing all along, the Blorg took their names from these transmissions and went out into the stars in search of friends, hoping one day to find the source of these messages so that they might party together."
