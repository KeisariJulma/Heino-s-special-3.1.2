They were able to land on a remote part of the [abduction_planet.GetPlanetMoon] in the cover of darkness and seize several specimens of a large, black and white speckled mammalian creature, which did not resist.\n\nOnly later did we realize that these creatures were not making any of the sounds characteristic of [This.ContactCountry.GetName] transmissions, nor indeed giving any indication whatsoever of being sentient. Upon further investigation, we concluded that we had accidentally captured examples of their livestock!\n\nUnfortunately, their space patrols have stepped up in vigilance since the raid, indicating that they have detected our presence - making any further attempts be doomed to failure..."
 first_contact.322.desc.planet:0 "While some were worried at the incursion of unknown alien vessels into our space, it was not clear until now just how much of a threat the [From.Owner.GetName] posed. It seems they landed a covert team on a remote part of [abduction_planet.GetName] and seized living [This.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] hostages, escaping into the depths of space before we could mount a rescue party. We can only imagine what tortures they will suffer at the hands of their captors."

It seems the [From.Owner.GetName] landed a covert team on a remote part of [abduction_planet.GetName] and seized several [This.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] drones, along with some of our hardware, escaping into the depths of space before we could send a party to destroy them. We can only hope they will be unable to find out much of value from what they have taken."
 first_contact_critters.15.desc:1 "The spaceborne lifeforms - which the [Owner.GetAdj] Head of Society Research has come to refer to as "§HTiyanki§!" - are docile creatures. Capable of accessing some lower dimension of subspace, they roam from system to system with remarkable ease.\n\nThey graze on gases common to the upper layers of many gas giants. It is highly unlikely, to say the least, that this is their only food source, but intake of other nutrients has yet to be observed.\n\nThey will rarely, if ever, attack, even when provoked. They can safely be ignored."
 first_contact_critters.25.desc:1 "The entities encountered by our fleets some time ago are new, spaceborne lifeforms.\n\nQuickly nicknamed §H"Space Amoeba"§! following a gross misreading of initial sensor output, the creature is in fact larger than the average [Owner.GetAdj] corvette."
 first_contact_critters.45.desc:0 "Reports of the deep-space drones previously encountered have been investigated closer. The drones appear to be the workers and custodians of an autonomous orbital mining operation, established millennia ago and then soon abandoned by all but the drones themselves, judging by the state of the processing equipment.\n\nThe drones possess powerful mining lasers and make obviously threatening, if not outright hostile, overtures toward [Owner.GetAdj] vessels when approached. They may only be old drones, but they should be kept under close watch by the [Owner.GetName]."
