 site_hunting_ground_intro:0 "Fossilized remains from several different species that do not appear to have been indigenous to [From.Planet.GetName] have been found in a large and secluded valley on the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. They all date from roughly the same time period, within the span of a few centuries some 3.6 million years ago.\n\nEach of these species seems to have evolved in its own unique biosphere, and all appear to have been sapient. Strangely, every fossilized individual found so far shows signs of having met a violent end."
 site_zarqlan_intro:0 "A chameleon energy field of some sort concealed an ancient structure on the surface of this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. Only a chance asteroid impact which was deflected off the field while it was being monitored revealed its existence.\n\nWith the field deactivated, archaeologists will now have access to the large and forbidding building complex that was hidden beneath it."
 ancrel.104.desc:0 "The devastation is almost total, but a few scattered records have survived. It seems that the people of [From.Planet.GetName] were obsessed with the idea that aliens were observing them. Frequent reports of Unidentified Flying Objects, animal mutilation, and abductions drove the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] into a frenzy. In reaction countless resources were poured into vast detection arrays, anti-spacecraft defenses, and underground shelters to protect the population."

 ancrel.2.desc:1 "The strange ruins show no sign of damage beyond neglect. Homes, factories, buildings of unknown use: they all stand empty and abandoned. Where did everyone go?\n\nIt seems likely that a large building in the center of the colony may hold the answers."
 ancrel.4.desc:1 "After a great deal of trial and error, a breakthrough has been made. The crystal is some kind of Psionic Archive, but its records are fragmented.\n\nWhat we know is that this was a colony of the §HZroni§!, a psionically-gifted race who discovered a dimension which came to be known as "The Shroud". Once the Zroni population reached critical mass, it seems that their collective unconscious minds began to make contact with the proto-shroud in dreams, leading to mass lucid dreaming. The phenomenon was studied, and the Zroni discovered how to psionically project themselves into the Shroud - at which point they also found that they could manipulate the very fabric of reality, using their psionic powers.\n\nIt wasn't long before the Zroni discovered they could physically enter the Shroud and live like gods, transforming the dimension to suit their whims...\n\nThe Archive's records end there, with no information on what happened to the inhabitants of [From.Planet.GetName]. But while there are no answers here, we have learned of another Zroni colony which may contain a more complete Archive..."
 ancrel.5.desc:0 "[From.Planet.GetName] contains the ruins of another abandoned Zroni colony. The first step to solving this mystery is to find, and make contact with, this world's Psionic Archive."
 ancrel.6.desc:1 "It was much easier to establish contact with the crystal this time around, using protocols we established with the previous one. Again, its records are fragmented, but we have learned that another advantage of being able to enter the Shroud was that the Shroud touches all parts of the physical galaxy - perhaps all parts of the universe - simultaneously. If one can enter the Shroud, it is possible to exit it at any known location.\n\nThis ability to "jump" between physical locations allowed the Zroni to spread to all corners of the galaxy. Because they spent most of their time within the Shroud, the Zroni established relatively few permanent colonies. Those they did set up were mostly located near to their homeworld, Zron Prime.\n\nThis crystal has given us the location of another colony."
 ancrel.7.desc:1 "Finding and communicating with the Psionic Archives has become much easier now. Contact can be made as soon as our expedition lands, at which point we can access more detailed records and concepts. From what we have learned here, some things are too good to be true - and so it was with the godhood granted to the Zroni by the Shroud.\n\nThe energy required to power the vast changes in the Shroud's composition had to come from somewhere, and for them it originated from the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. As the Zroni made their changes within the Shroud, so the singularity expanded, consuming the mass of the galactic center and converting it into energy which was then siphoned into the Shroud. This discovery shook the Zroni: debate turned to argument, which led to to division, which culminated in a civil war between their two main factions."
 ancrel.8.desc:1 "Further details of the Zroni Civil War factions have been extracted from the crystal.\n\nOne faction - which came to be known as "The Divine" - felt that the fate of the physical galaxy was of no concern to the Zroni, who could continue their omnipotent existence in the Shroud until the entire galaxy was consumed in some unimaginably far off future. Even then, there are other galaxies, perhaps even other universes, which could conceivably be consumed.\n\nThe other faction, "The Saviors", were aghast at this; the Zroni should not destroy the galaxy to live as parasitic gods! Even outside of the Shroud, their psionic abilities guaranteed them a utopian existence.\n\nThe location of another Zroni colony has also been discovered."
 ancrel.10.desc:1 "A much smaller psionic crystal has been located in some kind of laboratory. The Zroni who recorded their findings within were extremely frustrated: their research had been ridiculed by their peers, and was largely discredited. They believed that the Zroni were no longer the only entities in the Shroud, and that the collective fears and desires of their entire race were coalescing into distinct, sapient entities.\n\nDesiring to grow stronger, these entities had begun to subtly influence the emotions and thoughts of suitable Zroni, slowly causing their behaviors to become more extreme. This may have directly caused the Zroni civil war.\n\nWe also discovered a location reference for one of the Zroni's major colonies."
 ancrel.12.desc:1 "Most of the accessible records focus on the course of the war. Our working theory is that the mood of the population influences the "strength" of the record about a subject, meaning the most thought-about issues are recorded with greater prominence. Unsurprisingly, the course of the war was on everyone's mind.\n\nThe majority of the Zroni sided with the Saviors, but while they had an advantage in numbers they bore one significant disadvantage: heedless of their effects on the galaxy, the Divine were free to use their full psionic might; meanwhile the Saviors were limited to whatever power could be drawn from their own bodies.\n\nAt first the war seemed hopeless, but eventually a hero amongst the Saviors would make a terrible - yet vital - discovery..."
 ancrel.13.desc:0 "The crystal tells us how a rogue Zroni researcher - working on a theory which his peers refused to believe - turned his power inwards, consuming his own body in a contained psionic chain-reaction. Following his last instructions, the dusty residue of his supreme sacrifice was tested and confirmed to be an incredibly potent source of psionic energy. It was essentially the sum total psionic potential of his life, rendered instantly usable by another psion.\n\nThe crystal also contains the location of the Zroni homeworld."
 ancrel.13.a:0 "The dust... is the Zroni!"
 ancrel.16.desc:1 "We have found, and communicated with, several crystals, including one from the outcast Shroud-entity researchers. With these, we are learning more about the Zroni's war.\n\nUsing the Zro dust required great sacrifice from the Saviors, but with it they were able to turn the tide of their war against the Divine. As their defeat loomed, the ever-increasing rage and fear of the Divine spawned new and terrible entities within the Shroud. The feedback loop grew, pushing the Divine into the depths of madness. They were driven to ever-worsening atrocities, urging the Saviors to end the war at any cost."
 ancrel.17.desc:1 "As we communicate with more crystals, more details emerge.\n\nOn the brink of defeat, the Divine decided upon their ultimate plan: the end of the cycle. The growth of the black hole galactic core would be accelerated to consume the galaxy as soon as possible. At worst, the Saviors - and every other species in the galaxy - would be destroyed, leaving the Divine to rule the shroud for a vast but finite time. It was, however, possible that the expansion would become self-sustaining, consuming not just the galaxy but the universe itself: providing a source of energy which may not be infinite, but would at least come close enough amount to make no practical difference."
 ancrel.18.desc:0 "We have learned the fate of the Zroni.\n\nWhen the Saviors learned of the Divine's plan, they knew there was only one possible counter to the Divine's almost-impenetrable defenses in the Shroud. Faced with annihilation, they chose to sacrifice their entire population save for one Zroni. This last remaining Savior used the psionic residue of an entire species to utterly destroy every Zroni - and thus every Divine - in existence, ending the threat for all time.\n\nThe Zroni were wiped out almost without a trace, save for a small amount of unconsumed dust that is scattered across the galaxy."

The civilization seems to have been built along an unexploited ore vein. Excavating the site will impede our mining operations on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] and would make abstraction from the new vein impossible but could lead to new scientific discovery."
 site_moon_bump_intro:0 "Even with the naked eye it is easy to see something highly irregular in the shape of [From.Planet.GetName]. The smooth curvature of the surface is suddenly interrupted by a gigantic spherical bump. At some point a moonlet or large asteroid collided with the surface, but must have done so in a fairly delicate manner, merely lodging itself in the crust rather than rending it asunder."
 ancrel.9010.desc:0 "Tunneling to the center of the impact zone, it soon became evident how the giant space rock crashed on the city. The locality had been the anchor point of a surface-to-orbit tether: a space elevator leading from the surface all the way to the small moonlet.\n\nDue to some accident - or a severe miscalculation done by the engineering department - the tether pulled the space rock too hard, upsetting the centrifugal forces and shifting the moonlet to just inside the gravity well. With gravity now the enemy, even the super-dense structure of the space elevator could only slow the moonlet's descent, not stop it. Menacingly, inexorably, the rock came crashing down on the helpless city below."
 ancrel.9015.desc:0 "The mystery of the crashed moonlet has been solved. The city it landed on was utterly destroyed, of course, so it was in a ruined suburb outside the impact zone that the revelation was found. A digital fragment, recorded mere hours before the calamity struck, spoke of strange lights and electromagnetic readings in the night sky. A bright flash was seen, and within minutes the moonlet was slowly descending towards the doomed city.\n\nIt is established, with a very small margin of error, that vessels of some powerful alien civilization appeared over [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] and deliberately nudged the moonlet out of its geosynchronous orbit and towards the surface. They appear to have deliberately slowed the moonlet's descent, although we cannot say if this was due to an intentional effort to preserve the rest of the world for their own later colonization, a psychological warfare tactic of mass terrorization, or something else entirely."
 ancrel.9020.desc:0 "It may go down as the biggest botch in scientific history. Deep core samples indicate that the center of the crashed moonlet was composed of highly pure metal ores. Coveting these, in defiance of all logic and sane engineering principles, the population of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] constructed an electromagnet of gargantuan proportions. It seems their intent was to pull the moonlet in to a closer orbit in order to mine its riches more easily.\n\nSure enough, the magnet was activated and hauled the moonlet towards the surface of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] - but too hard and too fast. The inhabitants frantically tried to reverse the electromagnetic beam, but succeeded only in slowing the metallic orb's descent, not stopping it. The moonlet crashed into the surface with enough force to wipe out the entire hemisphere. In the aftermath, the dust and debris cloud from the impact blotted out the sun for decades, which eradicated all life on the rest of the world.\n\nWhat did they expect?!"
 site_echoes_inside_intro:0 "Readings from [From.Planet.GetName] reveal that it was once mostly covered in lush vegetation. Now the forlorn orb is little more than a barren rock.\n\nDespite lacking any noteworthy tectonic activity, sensory scans of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] have registered puzzling seismographic data. Something is moving underground, something big. This warrants further investigation."
 ancrel.9025.desc:0 "Surface scans reveal the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] to be covered in desiccated flatlands - large areas covered in fine, dusty sediment. Analysis shows that the sediment traces are all that is left of extensive tracts of vegetation that must have died and dried out with unnatural speed.\n\nFurthermore, many of the dry patches have crumbled to reveal a vast cave system just beneath the surface. This surveying trip just turned into a spelunking expedition!"
 ancrel.9035.desc:0 "A single, worm-like creature of gargantuan proportions is responsible for the tunnels dug - or rather eaten - through the crust of [From.Planet.GetName]. The process is slowing down, most likely because the giant worm is slowly starving. It is responsible for the dead vegetation: once it fed by burrowing close to the surface and excreting an enzyme that broke down organic matter, which seeped into the soil to nourish the beast.\n\nThe worm is not indigenous to [From.Planet.GetName], and as yet we have no clue how it ended up on the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]."
 ancrel.9040.desc:0 "Further scans of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface picked up a single artificial structure. It appears to be an old, abandoned science outpost of alien design, and it stands alone in a desert of dust and ash.\n\nSpeculatively translated research logs speak of a biological terror weapon, one that lies dormant in the soil of a planet until activated. It then begins to consume the whole ecosystem with devastating speed. The unfortunate beings living there see their once-verdant home turned inexorably into a lifeless desolation. One excerpt is particularly ominous: ... the larva seeding project is on schedule, and soon most of the known habitable planets in the galaxy will have a 'sleeper'."
 ancrel.9070.desc:0 "Clearing away the rubble is a painstaking and risky business. Workers and equipment have to be hoisted down hundreds of meters to the dig site, and excavated rubble has to be lifted out. There have been numerous casualties and accidents while working in these trying conditions, but progress is being made, and every day we venture deeper. The walls of the crater are worn and cracked by time, but they plunge unerringly, straight down into the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s core.\n\nWe can still only speculate how deep it goes, as something in the depths is garbling all our sensor readings."
 ancrel.9080.desc:0 "At long last, we reached the bottom of the shaft, and made an astonishing discovery: mangled by the crash and half-melted during atmospheric reentry, it is nonetheless indisputably a spacecraft of advanced, alien design. Despite being buried under thousands of tons of debris after enduring a catastrophic descent, it is remarkably intact. The ship was found with the prow pointing downward, which leads to the assumption that it went straight into the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] at extremely high velocity. We will probably never know why.\n\nHow the ship managed to retain structural integrity despite all this is up for debate, but the strongest theory is that it was encased in some form of advanced energy field far beyond our own most cutting edge technologies. Limned in incinerating light, the craft shot through the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust like a superheated projectile, until finally grinding to a halt in the darkness."
 ancrel.9085.desc:0 "The excavation finally reached the bottom of the crater, where they found an ancient drilling machine of colossal proportions slumbering in the dark. Further study of it revealed that it carried a tremendous fusion bomb, set for remote detonation.\n\nThe going theory is that the drilling machine was supposed to dig itself down to the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s core and then detonate its payload, which would result in a catastrophic shattering of the entire world. Why anyone would want to do this remains unclear."
 ancrel.9100.desc:0 "The discovery of the first crashed flying machine set us on the right path, and led to the discovery of a multitude of similar crash sites littering the surface of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon].\n\nWithout doubt, these strange, dead machines have something to do with the mysterious geometrical shapes that dot this world, but the extent of the damage caused by crash landings from high altitude will make analysis difficult."
 ancrel.9110.desc:0 "Analysis of the crashed machinery turned out to give all the answers. The machines were huge energy cutters, flying around in orbit cutting and sculpting the surface landscape with powerful laser beams. One of the machines contained data fragments that explained that the entire [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]-shaping project was a custom job ordered by an unknown client, indicating some market-driven civilization of tremendous capability.\n\nThis just gave a whole new meaning to the concept of terraforming."
 ancrel.9115.desc:0 "After recovering one of the more intact crashed wrecks and reverse-engineering it, the purpose of this orbital network became clear. The machines were automated cutting beams placed around [FromFrom.Planet.GetName]. Their function was to completely dismantle the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], carving it up piece by piece over a span of centuries.\n\nNot long after the endeavor began, perhaps a few decades based on projections, something interrupted the procedure. The automated cutters lost power and their orbit decayed, until one by one they smashed themselves to bits on the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. Theories abound as to why anyone would do this. Whether it was mining on a hitherto unimagined scale, some obscure doomsday cult out to break and remake the world, a quirk of unknowable alien psychology, or just code that went awry after the original creators vanished, none can say."
 ancrel.9145.desc:0 "An extensive analysis of hundreds of canals on the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface has been carried out. It is evident that the intricate canal grid is not formed by any naturally-occurring geological process - it has been dug out with deliberate intent.\n\nDue to the considerable age of the trenches - having been carved out more than a hundred thousand years prior, and as such considerably eroded - it is difficult to ascertain how or why they were made."
 ancrel.9150.desc:0 "More findings from the excavation sites on [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] have come in, and with them a new theory for the origins of the trench network. Millenia ago the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was beset by an invading extraterrestrial organism, best described as a huge snail-like creature the size of a city. It roamed with impunity, scouring the surface clean of all organic matter it touched. The trenches were dug out by the indigenous population of diminutive mustelid-like humanoids, in order to either escape the snail's onslaught, or to try to attack its vulnerable underbelly. By the extent of the excavation, this trench war must have gone on for generations, perhaps centuries.\n\nThere are no indications the local population survived the crisis, nor are there any remains of the behemoth that devoured them. A grim fate, indeed."
 ancrel.9155.desc:0 "The mystery of the canals was swiftly resolved thanks to a recent breakthrough. The wreck of a cruiser-sized machine was discovered, thousands of years old and pitted with age and exposure. Analysis quickly established that it was a burrowing automaton, activated and let loose on the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] in order to prepare irrigation canals that would facilitate the transformation of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] into one giant mega-farm.\n\nDue to a programming error or a miscalculated deactivation date, the thoughtless machine stoically continued its mission to dig canals across the surface until it finally broke down, without a seed ever being planted."
 ancrel.9160.desc:0 "Eons past, an unknown event triggered a shockingly swift ice age on [FromFrom.Planet.GetName], that within a few decades left the entire surface covered in a crushing sheet of ice. The trenches were shaped by indigenous mole-like beings digging frantically in every direction between the bedrock and the underside of the glacier cover, all in a futile attempt to regain the surface.\n\nHow an entire [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] could be encased in ice in such a short period is utterly perplexing. The main working theory at present is that the ice blanket it was deliberately inflicted during some sort of conflict, but how, or by whom, remains a mystery."
 ancrel.9165.desc:0 "There is clear evidence that [From.Planet.GetName] was at some point inhabited by a sapient species. Ruins that have been found of an industrial age civilization on the cusp of pre-FTL spaceflight.\n\nAt some point, however, this civilization was struck with a [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]-wide calamity and totally extinguished. Little more than rubble remains, and there are no signs that any protective measures were taken by the afflicted population. The event was not violent or destructive, everything just seemed to... stop. Whatever hit them came as a complete surprise... or, perhaps, they chose not to resist it."
 ancrel.9170.desc:0 "Beneath the ruins of the largest city, an amazing discovery was made! An artificial underground complex of immense proportions was detected by surface-penetrating sensors. The entrance, highly elaborate in design and possibly ceremonial in nature, was easily located, but further exploration was quickly halted.\n\n[From.Planet.GetName]'s planetary companions exert exceptionally powerful tidal forces, so strong in fact that they affect the motion of magma currents in the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s core. The underground complex seems to be built with this in mind, with the corridors and chambers periodically flooded with running lava. Luckily enough the ebb and flow can be predicted, but it is as yet a mystery why a relatively advanced civilization would construct a subterranean deathtrap like this."
 site_sky_glow_hymn_intro:0 "Surface scans of [From.Planet.GetName] picked up signs that a technological civilization may have been active on the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], but has since gone extinct. We will need to mount a surface expedition to learn more."
 site_warmer_climates_intro:0 "Orbital imagery of [From.Planet.GetName] clearly shows the infrastructure of a technological civilization. Mysteriously, despite massive urban areas linked by an extensive surface transport network, the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] seems totally abandoned, with no signs of extant sentient life. The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s core is more active than most, but there is no sign of any disastrous event or anything else that would immediately explain the missing population. Where did they all go?"
 ancrel.9220.desc:0 "The investigation into [From.Planet.GetName]'s missing population has made a breakthrough. Large sealed shield doors leading to a deep tunnel network stand as proof that the entire species started to move underground at some point. Cross-examination with geological and meteorological data indicates that the entire [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was gripped by a sudden onset ice age, perhaps triggered by a shift in axial tilt, which likely triggered the migration.\n\nExcursions into the vast tunnel network are underway."
 ancrel.9225.desc:1 "Thousands of years ago the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s average temperature dropped precipitously, and most sunlight was blotted out by clouds. To cope with the suddenly freezing climate the population migrated underground, forced to burrow deeper and deeper chasing the retreating warmth of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s core.\n\nUnable to maintain their burrowing population, a cryo-torpor project was initiated. It would automatically awaken them once the instruments detected a stable surface climate again. The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] did finally warm up, but the process was extremely sudden, de-calibrating the hibernation pods and incinerating the sleepers.\n\nAll that remains are millions of pods filled with charred bones, sitting in silent rows in the dark."
 ancrel.9230.desc:0 "The expedition has returned with an answer to the mystery of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] and its missing people. Most of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s population died out in the sudden, chaotic ice age. The remnants of the species migrated deeper into the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust to get closer to the cooling core, which was the only remaining source of warmth and energy in the ice age's wake.\n\nA tremendous subterranean engineering projected was initiated by the survivors. In a desperate attempt to thaw their frozen world, they tried to channel geothermal heat from the planetary core up to the surface. But something went terribly wrong, and the core rejuvenation spiraled out of control, flooding the shelter tunnels with magma and superheated gas, wiping out all the survivors in an instant."
 ancrel.9235.desc:0 "The expedition has returned with a sad tale to tell. Thousands of years ago the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s core temperature dropped precipitously, forcing the population underground in search of heat, energy and resources. Year after year the temperature dropped, and they kept digging deeper and deeper. Their numbers dwindled as most froze, starved, or perished in digging accidents. This went on for decades.\n\nIn a minute hand-dug tunnel in the very deepest shaft, far past the sublevel where the last digging machines lay broken down and abandoned, a single, ice-fossilized molluscoid cadaver was found. A recorded message was found in which it claimed to be the last of its kind. It was cold and alone, and it was ready to give up."
 ancrel.9240.desc:0 "Our surface expedition has reported back some astounding findings. The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] has multiple major cities, all abandoned but in quite good shape considering their age. The infrastructure and urban planning of each city is remarkably structured and harmonious, indicating a highly cohesive civilization driven by centralized, collective ideals - perhaps even a gestalt consciousness of some kind.\n\nBased on the architecture and interior fixtures, the species that built all this seems to have been small fungoids, with a fairly low state of technical advancement. Where exactly they all went remains unknown."
 ancrel.9245.desc:0 "Further studies of the lost civilization of [From.Planet.GetName] have given rise to more questions than answers. The plain, sturdy structures are thousands of years old, and all seem to have been constructed at roughly the same time, perhaps as brief as a single century. Similarly, any additions or renovations to the urban structure seemed to be done [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]-wide at sudden, widely-separated intervals. The oddly-punctuated development of this society seems to show no appreciable change in population size."
 ancrel.9250.desc:0 "A recent breakthrough shone some light on the vanished city builders of [From.Planet.GetName]. Apparently, the fungal species has a collective cycle of mass death and rebirth. They hatch en masse, almost simultaneously across the whole [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], and grow up as part of a linked hive mind collective. In the course of their hundreds of years long life cycle, they spread out and reclaim the cities built and abandoned by previous died-off generations.\n\nWhen nearing the next death/rebirth event, they heed some species-wide biological clarion call. Through asexual reproduction they give birth to a pod that is buried in the ground. The parent dies, and the body decays and fertilizes the ground around the pod. After a long dormant period, the pods hatch, and the cycle begins anew."
 ancrel.9255.desc:0 "Soil excavations on [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] finally revealed the fate of the missing population. They were all in their gestation pod state in the ground, growing and getting ready to emerge, when some natural phenomenon - most likely a meteor impact that upset weather and seasons for a few decades - disrupted the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s ecosystem. As they hatched they found a world devoid of sustenance.\n\nWhat should have been shared, celebratory rebirth quickly turned into a slow, collective starvation - and ultimately the species' extinction."
 ancrel.9265.desc:0 "The final answer to the mystery of the vanished fungoid society turned out to be fairly straightforward. The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s population is not lost at all! They're still there, gestating underground. Analysis of an uncovered pod indicated that the species' centuries-long active lifespan was nothing compared to the pod-state gestation, which seems to go on for a few thousand years. Their simple cities, built to withstand long neglect, stand silently, awaiting their return.\n\nSo, there they all are, slumbering in the ground, awaiting the day when they'll rise and start the cycle once more."
 site_grand_herald_intro:1 "Even without instruments, one can readily see the remains of vast conurbations down on [From.Planet.GetName]. Clearly a highly advanced civilization once dwelt there, but today there are no life signs nor electromagnetic signals consistent with a technological society. The [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] seems dead. We will have to go down there to find out more."
 ancrel.9275.desc:1 "Sifting through the abundance of documentation found in the ruins across the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] - this species sure loved their written word - one recurring concept stands out. It's referred to as §HThe Testament of Omen§!, and it is some portent of impending doom that triggered paranoia and dread in the general population.\n\nDue to the metaphorical and esoteric nature of the scriptural language, it's difficult to ascertain the true nature of this menace, but the effect on the psyche of the indigenous species is indisputable. En masse they seem to have looked to the heavens for divine intervention."
 ancrel.9280.desc:1 "Architectural analysis has isolated the buildings that were assembled just before the civilization vanished. The pattern is the same across the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]: haphazard utilitarian constructs intended for heavy industrial work. Unlike older dwellings, these buildings are unadorned and noticeably pragmatic in their design. Perhaps a culture of iconoclasm took hold?\n\nOver the entrance of each of these buildings is §HThe Creed of Servitude§! - a prayer of service to §HThe Grand Herald§! and its holy plan. The theory is that this is some kind of response to the doom foretold in §HThe Testament of Omen§!."
 ancrel.9290.desc:1 "§HThe Hymn of Following§! was not an isolated event - it was global, every single inhabitant chanting in unison. Such an unusual event warranted further research, and that's when a new insight was gained. A document called §HThe Pilgrimage of Last Days§! was uncovered, and it seems to be one of the last links in this mysterious chain of events.\n\nThe document refers to a specific location on the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], where some final reckoning or ritual will occur; a swathe of unremarkable desert location neglected in earlier surveys. The document also speaks of something called §HThe Rite of Lifted Veil§!, which is now being interpreted."
 ancrel.9295.desc:2 "Hidden from orbital scanning by sophisticated optical camouflage, §HThe Grand Herald§! was finally uncovered. It's not a prophet or religious figure; it is a gigantic Titan-class starship! Their world torn and dying due to wars carried out in the name of religion, the Titan was going to serve as an ark ship for a fraction of the population, transporting them off the doomed [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] and towards an unspecified promised land offworld. The ship is fully assembled and workable condition, so why it never took flight is puzzling.\n\nIt appears as if some final battle must have been fought just prior to takeoff. A struggle so fierce that neither side survived in the long run."
 ancrel.9300.desc:1 "It was never a religious archetype! After having deactivated an optical camouflage field, the expedition saw the true shape of §HThe Grand Herald§!; an immense Titan-class starship half-buried in the sand, built to fight some kind of approaching threat in space. As it turns out, the poetic, metaphorical nature of the native language - interpreted as being of religious expression - was in fact just the normal way this species communicated.\n\nThe nature of the oncoming menace is still a mystery, but from the looks of it, whatever it was seems to have arrived before the Titan was fully operational. Scattered around the ship are thousands of desiccated remains of the extinct species of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName]. They did not have time to activate their Titan, and they never will."
 ancrel.9305.desc:2 "§HThe Grand Herald§! is an unconventional religious figure, indeed. It's a huge special engineering project - an automated construction yard. Its skyscraper-high spars still cradle its first and only product; a huge Titan-class starship. Where spiritual metaphor and archaeological fact intersect is still not entirely clear, but we know this: whatever threat §HThe Testament of Omen§! spoke of must have indeed come to pass, as the entire population died mysteriously prior to The Grand Herald project being concluded.\n\nBut the automated construction yard kept working, finalizing a ship without passengers. The mostly intact, empty ship has been slumbering here for eons without someone to pilot it. Shall we take it out for a spin?"
 ancrel.9320.desc:1 "Another deep sea expedition has returned, and revealed the truth of the churning seas of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName]. All the strange organic formations on the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] are actually connected in a single, vast coral reef. This coral, as it turned out, is partly aware, although with an utterly alien mindset compared to our conception of sentient life. Through pheromones excreted in the water, it has more or less enslaved the rest of all the organisms in the sea, controlling their behavior and reproduction cycles to fit its own needs.\n\nIt seems to be completely benign, but it is a puppet master nonetheless. Is it simply the apex life form on this world? An intrusive alien parasite? Communicating with it seems impossible, so we may never know."
 ancrel.9330.desc:1 "It's all one giant bio-machine! Subsurface analysis indicates that the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s oceans were once dead - no current or oxygen to sustain underwater life. This bio-engineered machine was introduced to the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] with the purpose of artificially jump starting the basic prerequisites of organic existence.\n\nApparently it worked, as underwater flora and fauna now thrives on the world. No trace was found of why such a colossal undertaking was carried out, nor by whom - was it perhaps some terraforming project by an unknown aquatic species with advanced biotechnology, seeking to create for themselves a new home?"
 ancrel.9340.desc:1 "The answer to the mysterious craters in the ocean floor was finally found in an analysis of the water itself. Traces of certain minerals and chemical compositions proved that the water did in fact not belong to the same [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. It was transported here in the form of gargantuan blocks of ice that were hurled down on the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. The ice blocks crashed, cracked into splinters and melted, eventually covering almost the entire surface with water.\n\nIt was an absolutely monumental undertaking, but there is nothing that hints to why it was carried out."
 ancrel.9345.desc:1 "The Science Ship in orbit of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName] picked up some unidentified energy readings from deep beneath the waves, and upon inspection the expedition discovered an ancient construction. A structure many kilometers long with a single purpose; to artificially create underwater currents.\n\nUnderwater circulation is vital for much aquatic life, and the current theory is that this [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was set up to be habitable for some aquatic, spacefaring species. It appears as if they never showed up."
 ancrel.9350.desc:1 "By following a strange energy signature our expedition managed to locate an alien communications array buried deep in the seabed. It contained information fragments, and once translated they told of the water-introduction project.\n\nAccording to the translation the entire ocean-making venture was done to create an immense submerged storage, but it does not specify what needed to be stored. Certainly not what requires an entire [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] covered in water."
 ancrel.9355.desc:1 "Thanks to serendipitous sensory scan the Science Ship managed to isolate ancient building buried deep under the ocean floor. Getting the expedition there turned out to be very difficult, but the finding was grand.\n\nThe building was once a climate control center. It directed giant climate-altering machines in orbit. This was a terraforming project that was interrupted, but apparently the project had gotten far enough. Even without directed input, nature managed to thrive and eventually create the ecosystem that can be seen today."
 site_fossilized_jellyfish_intro:1 "The Science Ship in orbit around [From.Planet.GetName] has detected clusters of small, round islands dotting the ocean [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. From a geological standpoint they are highly unusual: the surface appears natural, with no artificial constructions, yet they all appear to be circular in shape, nearly perfectly so. We will need to head down there to gather more data."
 ancrel.9365.desc:1 "As the surface expedition delved deeper into the round islands, two more discoveries were made: First, that every island seem to have a duplicate internal layout of tunnels beneath them. They vary slightly in size, but not in how they are laid out. The second discovery was even more astonishing: the islands aren't parts of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s crust - they actually float! Their lower levels are filled with pockets of gas, which combined with the fairly brittle and porous island rock makes then buoyant."
 ancrel.9380.desc:1 "They aren't islands at all. They are all alien organisms: jellyfish creatures that for some reason were artificially introduced to the ecosystem. It seems their introduction did not go exactly as planned, however. Most of the big ones died and fossilized - becoming the floating island archipelago - but the smaller jellyfish creatures assimilated and are now thriving in the oceans across the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]. Whether they will eventually share the fate of their bigger ancestors remains to be seen."

The magnetism of this neutron star effectively boiled the metals inside [FromFrom.Planet.GetName], turning them into the molten oceans we see today. The electromagneticism we've encountered is but a lingering echo of the original, cataclysmic event.\n\nWhere the neutron star is now remains a mystery - a quite disturbing mystery."
 ancrel.9420.desc:2 "The blatant disregard for conventional laws of physics has our science department considering "external forces" as an explanation for the strange properties of [FromFrom.Planet.GetName].\n\nAn impact crater - in combination with fusion drive particle traces found in orbit - suggests that the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] was fired upon by some kind of electric super-weapon at some point. The severity of the strike was such that all metals on the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] melted, and the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is still crackling with residual electricity.\n\nWhat warranted such tremendous attack? We'll never know."
 ancrel.9425.desc:1 "Once the sensors had been re-calibrated to compensate for the interference, a new discovery was made: an abandoned research station, located on a nearby moon. Fragments of data were salvaged from the almost entirely burned-out records, detailing an experiment involving a giant, artificial magnet on the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface.\n\nThe experiment was a bit too successful. It turned the [FromFrom.Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s entire, metal crust into molten pools with an electromagnetic charge so intense that it fried the research station in an instant.\n\nWell...
