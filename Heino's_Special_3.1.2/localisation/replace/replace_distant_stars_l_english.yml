 distar.25.desc:0 "In studying the surface of [From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] discovered the ruins of an early space age civilization. Though no living members of this civilization remain, the [From.GetPlanetMoon] is still inhabited by the rudimentary robots they constructed.\n\nThese robots still go about their tasks, tirelessly repairing the crumbling infrastructure of their long-dead makers.\n\nAny future colonists may be able to make use of this ancient robotic workforce. If nothing else, they've certainly proved themselves resilient."
 distar.27.desc:0 "[Root.Owner.GetAdj] [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have expressed interest in studying the ancient robots on [Root.GetName], and the demise of the civilization that created them. Thus far, researchers have found no definitive proof of what eradicated the robots' makers - a puzzle exacerbated by the centuries that have long since turned any biological remains to dust.\n\nInspection of the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] has ruled out nuclear annihilation and extensive warfare as extinction events, but still the reason behind their disappearance eludes us.\n\nResearchers recommend launching a more intensive study of the ancient robots' hardware in an attempt to glean further insights."
 distar.36.desc:0 "The development of a vaccine to treat the epidemic affecting our populations on [Root.GetName] has successfully concluded. Distribution of the vaccine has begun, and life on [Root.GetName] should soon return to normal.\n\nResearch has revealed that the retrovirus behind this turmoil appears to have evolved on [Root.GetName] millions of years ago. Lying dormant in frozen biomatter, it resurfaced when the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s icecaps melted.\n\nIt is very likely this led to the demise of the ancient robots' makers, centuries ago. Luckily, the [Owner.GetName] is better equipped to deal with viral contaminants. The development of this vaccine has even led to some advancements in the field of medicine."
 distar.40.desc:0 "After detailed analysis, Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered that the strange metallic substance coating the surface of [From.GetName] in fact comprises of billions upon billions of nanites! These nanites are microscopic, self-replicating micro-machines, perhaps created by a past civilization for some unknown purpose.\n\nThe volume and density of this nanite sludge is remarkable, adding billions of tons of mass to the underlying [From.GetPlanetMoon]. It would appear these tiny self-replicators entered a state of runaway reproduction at some point in the past, engulfing the [From.GetPlanetMoon] and everything on it.\n\nIn studying the nanites, the crew has made some exciting new findings that will undoubtedly aid us in our own research."
 distar.95.desc:0 "The unique crystals found on [From.GetName] possess quite exceptional properties. The [Root.GetName] crew reports to have found their visit to the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface entirely soothing, leaving them refreshed and placated upon return to orbit. Apparently, the crystals resonate at a frequency known to be medically therapeutic for [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nIf ever we were to settle on [From.GetName], our populace would surely enjoy living in constant proximity to these resonant minerals."
 distar.100.desc:0 "Detailed study has revealed that [From.GetName]'s magnetic field was so attractive to drones in orbit due to the unique frequency at which it oscillates. It just so happens that the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s magnetosphere resonates at a rate that produces a focusing effect on the [Root.Owner.GetAdj] neural network.\n\nShould we inhabit [From.GetName], any [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] on the surface would be able to constantly enjoy the benefits of this magnetic resonance."
 distar.105.desc:0 "After intense study and sampling of the growth blanketing entire biospheres on [From.GetName], [Root.GetLeaderName] reports that the substance is not native to the [From.GetPlanetMoon], but rather an invasive fungal lifeform of unknown origin. The fungus feeds on biomatter, choking out existing plant life and enveloping terrain.\n\nAny future settlers on the [From.GetPlanetMoon] would have to deal with routinely burning back the exofungus - it is unknown at this point if it can be entirely eradicated."
 distar.110.desc:0 "Despite the seemingly frozen surface of [From.GetName], the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s orbital path around [From.GetStarName] leaves it blistering at several hundred degrees. Under normal circumstances this would sublimate the ice on [From.GetName]'s surface. However, extreme gravitational pressure exerted by the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s ultra-dense core keeps the water in a solid state, resulting in a [From.GetPlanetMoon] of fiery hot ice."
 distar.115.desc:0 "Boasting a scorching surface temperature and an atmosphere of corrosive mineral acids, [From.GetName] possesses extreme weather conditions responsible for reflecting certain bandwidths of electromagnetic radiation. Heavy metal compounds heated in the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s troposphere rise in gaseous form to high elevations, whereupon they rapidly cool, solidify, and rain back down to the surface. Simply put, it snows metal on the surface of [From.GetName]."
 distar.120.desc:0 "The extensive system of burrows far below the waves of [From.GetName]'s turquoise waters are the remains of a widespread population of likely sapient alien lifeforms. These land-bound arthropoids constructed thousands upon thousands of interconnected termite-like mounds on [From.GetName]'s surface, at a time when most of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s water was contained in polar icecaps. Rising planetary temperatures, however, slowly doomed the species that had persisted for millennia to a watery grave. None remain today."
 distar.125.desc:0 "The station in orbit of [From.GetName] was once a massive particle accelerator orders of magnitude beyond the capabilities of our own, where an alien nation studied the very nature of the universe. Its records reveal the aliens came to believe our universe existed in a false vacuum bubble - an inherently unstable energy state that could collapse into true vacuum at any time. If ever an instance of true vacuum came into existence, it would catalyze the conversion of the entire universe into its lowest energy state at the speed of light, destroying everything in existence at an observable - but inescapable - rate.\n\nThe station logs indicate the aliens deduced this process could be triggered by extremely high energy concentrations - just like the ones in their massive particle accelerator. They decided to forsake this technology, retreating into simple lives made possible by the bounties of [From.GetName]. Over time, they became the primitive species now found on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface."
 distar.145.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeaderName] and [Root.Leader.GetHisHer] crew have made a surprising discovery on [From.GetName]: the molten [From.GetPlanetMoon] is home to an exotic array of extremophilic microorganisms! These bacteria live deep inside the volcanic vents that scar the [From.GetPlanetMoon], thriving in the extremely high temperatures produced there.\n\nThis unprecedented find is our first known example of organic lifeforms flourishing on molten worlds. Moreover, the extremophiles on [From.GetName] are in fact responsible for the rare gases detected in its thin atmosphere, producing these valuable compounds as a byproduct of their metabolic processes."
 distar.156.desc:0 "The engineering crew manning the [Root.GetName] are pleased to report that the mysterious warship found on [From.From.GetName] has been successfully extracted from the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s hostile environment. Its corroded components have been repaired and replaced where needed, including its discharged power core.\n\nAs the hulking warship was powered back on and regained operative status, it swiftly became evident that the machine possesses a notable degree of artificial intelligence. We can communicate with it."

 distar.161.a:0 "Not yours. We found you alone on a [warform_planet.GetPlanetMoon]."
 distar.170.desc.machi:0 "The [Root.GetName] crew have made some astonishing discoveries on [From.GetName]. The abandoned primitive settlements first seen from orbit were once inhabited by a society of reptiles that still populate the [From.GetPlanetMoon] - but have since lost all capacity for sapient thought! In investigating how these creatures devolved from a tool-making agrarian society into mere beasts, [Root.GetLeaderName] made an unexpected find.\n\nThe burial remains of the settlement-dwelling reptiles possess a spinocranial organ not observed among their now-bestial counterparts. Testing has revealed these organs to be another species entirely - a sort of neural symbiont that connects with the host's brain stem via external attachment to the spine. These symbionts can still be found in hotsprings on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. It seems the union between the two species triggered the temporary uplift of the reptiles.\n\nWhat later interrupted this symbiosis, however, remains unknown."
 distar.180.desc:0 "Following a thorough investigation of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] crew has confirmed that the [From.GetPlanetMoon] used to be covered in flowing water, several billion years ago. However, the geochemical composition of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s basalt crust proved highly hydrophilic - so much so, that [From.GetName]'s thirsty rocks eventually absorbed and bound all of the water on its surface. Now all that remains of these vast oceans are salty brine streaks lining [From.GetName]'s numerous canyons.\n\nScience Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] adds that the mineral hydrates now dominating [From.GetName]'s landscape could have many valuable industrial applications."
 distar.185.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has made some troubling finds on [From.GetName]. The [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s megaflora is not only widespread and gargantuan in proportion, but also predatory. Various species of carnivorous plants rest patiently on its surface, releasing aromatic lures into the air and waiting for prey to come near. Sensitive tendrils on the terminus of the plant's leaves register the approach of animals, resulting in the plants snapping shut around their hapless prey, which are left to be slowly corroded by digestive acids.\n\n[Root.GetLeaderName] warns that any future colonists will have to steer clear of these predatory plants, as they appear more than capable of trapping a lone adult [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]."
 distar.230.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] crew have reported the presence of decaying orbital stations and multiple tomb worlds near the [From.GetName] system. Whatever interstellar nation once inhabited the [From.GetName] system appears to have collapsed into ruin long ago. [ratling_planet_tar.GetName] is a junkyard of a [ratling_planet_tar.GetPlanetMoon], covered in the irradiated, rusting remnants of demolished buildings, infrastructure and vehicles. No higher forms of life are recognizable.\n\nWe might gain more insight into this lost civilization by surveying any similar planets in this and neighboring systems."
 distar.233.desc:0 "Intelligence reports are coming in to [Root.Capital.GetName] regarding the hitherto lifeless surface of [notif_planet.GetName] in the [notif_planet.GetStarName] system. What our surveyors initially considered an uninhabited junkpile of a [notif_planet.GetPlanetMoon] is, in fact, home to a species of rat-like sapients!\n\nDubbed "$NAME_Ketlings$," these creatures had been living hidden from our view in tunnels in the [notif_planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s enormous scrap piles. The complex composition and incredible density of these massive junkheaps must have hindered earlier penetration by our scanners.\n\nWhatever may have brought the $NAME_Ketlings$ to the surface is thus far unknown, though now that we can observe them, we have noted their technology is almost entirely based on repurposed junk from the planetary ruins they inhabit.\n\nCould the $NAME_Ketlings$ be the last survivors of the lost interstellar civilization who made these ruins?

Replicating at an incredible rate, the nanites covered the entire surface of the [atomic_clock_planet.GetPlanetMoon] in a period of hours, proceeding to terraform it into a §YGaia World§!!\n\nHours after the completion of the terraforming event, the nanites involved in the process deactivated and decayed beyond recognition, leaving us with little ability to extract any information from them.\n\nHowever, their remains have peppered the surface of the now-very-tempting [atomic_clock_planet.GetPlanetMoon] with valuable metallic composites."
