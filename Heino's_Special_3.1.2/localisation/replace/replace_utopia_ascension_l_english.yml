 utopia.2600.desc:0 "Since the dawn of our civilization, tales have flourished of mighty sorcerers wielding powers that can only be described as supernatural in nature. These rare [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] could supposedly invade the minds of their fellows, lift heavy objects with merely a thought, or perform any number of other "magical" feats. Until recently, these stories were just that - stories.\n\nNow, however, our scientists have finally obtained conclusive evidence that proves the psionic potential inherent in certain [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] individuals. Although only a very small minority of our species as a whole seems to be gifted with psionic powers, their numbers relative to the total population have grown steadily over just the last few centuries.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of sudden evolutionary growth-spurt or because something has triggered latent psionic abilities that were always present in our genetic code, scientists cannot say."
 utopia.2602.1.desc:0 "Latent psionic powers have begun to manifest in certain individuals belonging to the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] species, according to leaked reports from authorities in the §Y[From.GetName]§!. This must be a fairly recent development, since we have no record of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ever displaying psionic abilities on file.\n\nAccording to the leaked reports, these powers are so far limited to a very small minority of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] species as a whole. Scientists in the §Y[From.GetName]§! have offered no explanation."
 utopia.2602.2.desc:0 "$utopia.2602.1.desc$\n\nThe [From.GetSpeciesAdj] population within our borders have begun exhibiting similar changes as well, so whatever is happening to their species is not localized to any single region of space."
 utopia.2650.desc:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] species has experienced what can only be described as a Great Awakening. For a time now, we have been aware of the great psionic potential inherent in our species, but such powers have only manifested themselves in a small minority... until now.\n\nAlmost overnight, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] everywhere have unlocked their full psionic capacity. It is as if some sort of communal pool of [Root.GetSpeciesName] psychic energy finally reached a critical tipping point, collectively awakening the latent abilities of our brains.\n\nTelepathy has already replaced most verbal communication between [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and this is only one small example of the innumerable changes our society is faced with. We are now tied together in a way few of us could have ever imagined."
 utopia.3100.desc:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName]... the vision is hazy and indistinct, but there can be no question - it is [Root.Capital.GetName], our capital. The great cities look different yet familiar, even through the obscuring wall of flames and smoke. Thousands... no, millions of mutilated bodies litter the streets, all of them [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. The stench of decay is unbearable.\n\n§P"YOUR FUTURE."§!\n\nNothing living remains in the ruins. In the sky above, massive orbital installations, trailing smoke and debris, have begun a slow and inevitable descent towards the [Root.Capital.GetPlanetMoon]. Are we witnessing one possible future out of many?\n\n§P"NOT ONE OF MANY. IT SHALL COME TO PASS. AS SURELY AS THE SUN RISES. IT IS YOUR DESTINY."§!\n\nThe vision ends as quickly as it began, leaving behind a miasma of swirling psychic energies."
 utopia.3150.desc:0 "We are looking down upon our galaxy from far above, at a distance of what must be hundreds of thousands of lightyears. Without warning, the psionic current plunges us down towards the myriad stars at an incredible speed, into the region of space belonging to one of the Fallen Empires - the [fallen_empire.GetName].\n\nStars swish by, then planets, until the vision finally settled on a [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesAdj] city. Incredible spires rise towards the sky, aided by anti-grav technology generations beyond our own. The current takes us into such a spire, through wall after wall until we reach a large meeting room of sorts. It is occupied by two [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural], floating comfortably in zero-gravity chairs while conversing with each other in soft voices.\n\nThey are oblivious to our presence."
 utopia.3152.desc:0 "The [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are clearly dignitaries of some kind, discussing matters of state. Slowly, surely, the vision encroaches upon them while their alien speech is gradually transformed into words that have meaning to us.\n\nSuddenly, the aliens go quiet and very still.\n\n§H"Can you feel it?"\n\n"Yes. Someone is watching."§!\n\nTheir eyes search the room until both of them are staring directly at us.\n\n§H"Remarkable. A psionic probe."§!\n\n§H"It appears [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] in origin. Quickly, activate the transplanar shield.§!"\n\nThe vision ends abruptly."
 utopia.3200.8.desc:0 "The corpse of a dead [Root.GetSpeciesName] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnName] tumbles through the void ahead. The putrid carcass emits a shrill screech before it vanishes out of sight."
 anomaly.2575.desc.3:0 "$anomaly.2575.desc.intro$\n\nUnfortunately, the §YDyson Sphere§! in this system has removed any possibility of restoring the [From.GetPlanetMoon]."
 utopia.3324.desc:0 "We have been unable to stop the monstrous energy being from enveloping §Y[Root.GetName]§!. The [Root.GetPlanetMoon] and everything living on it has been fully overtaken by The Shroud."
 utopia.3333.desc:0 "Ever since we invited the Whisperers into our minds, mental illness and unexplainable acts of violence have been on the rise among our psionic population. For the most part, it has been controllable, but recently things have gotten out of hand. A minor violent incident on §Y[planet_target.GetName]§! turned into a riot, and now the unrest and violence is spreading all across the [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon], causing a great deal of death and destruction."

 utopia.3335.desc:0 "Once again, the Eater has returned to claim its tribute, devouring a whole city on §Y[planet_target.GetName]§!. Though we have been able to keep our covenant with the Eater secret from the population at large, the remaining people on the [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon] are understandable fearful and angry over these 'mysterious disappearances' and are demanding an explanation from the government."
 utopia.3336.desc:0 "Once again, the Eater has returned to claim its tribute, devouring a significant part of the population on §Y[planet_target.GetName]§!. Though we have been able to keep our covenant with the Eater secret from the population at large, the remaining people on the [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon] are understandable fearful and angry over these 'mysterious disappearances' and are demanding an explanation from the government."
 utopia.3337.desc:0 "Once again, the Eater has returned to claim its tribute. Not content to merely claim a part of our population, the Eater has devoured a whole [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon] - not just its people, but animals, buildings... everything. §Y[planet_target.GetName]§! has been enveloped in a thick psionic fog, and rescue ships sent into the atmosphere have all failed to return. The loss of the [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon] is sending shockwaves across our empire, with citizens and local leaders alike demanding the government find an explanation for this cataclysmic event."
 utopia.3338.desc:0 "The desires inflicted upon our people by the Instrument are strong. The people of §Y[planet_target.GetName]§! have become convinced that their own particular customs are of distinct and paramount importance over those of our society as a whole. Alternative political movements are springing up like wildfire, and the political situation on the [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon] has become unpredictable, to say the least."
 utopia.3340.desc:0 "The desires inflicted upon our people by the Instrument are strong. The people of §Y[planet_target.GetName]§! have been caught in a frenzy of consumerism and decadence, demanding ever more exclusive goods, ever rarer and more savory foods. Already rioting has broken out at several shopping districts, and we have been forced to ramp up the production of our farms and industries to prevent the [planet_target.GetPlanetMoon] from descending into chaos."
 utopia.3341.desc:0 "The §YComposer of Strands§! has bestowed its blessings upon us, directly altering the genetic code of the §Y[species_target.GetAdj]§! species. Strangely, the rapid and unpredictable mutations have provoked no more than a very muted reaction. It seems our population has to come to treat the random and unpredictable mutations as little more than a normal part of life, hardly worthy of outrage, or even discussion."
