 utopia.5.desc.v1:0 "The experts sent to inspect the [From.GetAdj] ring world have scoured the construction site for a secret launch platform, yet found nothing to back our claims. We can only conclude that our intelligence was faulty, and review our sources more carefully the next time."
 utopia.5.desc.v2:0 "The researchers we sent to the [From.GetAdj] ring world have returned with new knowledge within the field of engineering. Despite some initial misunderstandings due to cultural differences, both teams were satisfied with the exchange and have learned much from each other."
 utopia.55.desc:0 "Dr. Groik's investigation into Xhaxxore's research has yielded some interesting results. Not only has Dr. Xhaxxore greatly exaggerated the effects of the serum, he has neglected to mention that they are only temporary. The side-effects, however, when over-used, can be quite permanent.\n\nThe essence itself has been extracted from a gland found in a species native to the [ointment_name.GetName] system, none other than the [target_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] of the [target_country.GetName]. Xhaxxore has held several [target_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] in cryostasis for months to secure the necessary supply of essence. It is likely that our diplomatic ties with their empire would suffer if they were to discover the truth."
 utopia.100.desc:0 "Unrest is rising on [missing_pops_planet.GetName] in light of a recent wave of [missing_pops_planet.GetPlanetMoon]-wide disappearances. Several thousand denizens have been reported missing in the last two months alone and the vast majority are from marginalized and isolated groups in remote areas. This could explain why it has taken so long to come to our attention.\n\nLocal law enforcement has requested additional resources to handle the growing unrest while they continue their investigation."

 utopia.2004.desc.a:0 "Our engineers and planetary ecologists today finished the last of the habitat sections on the Ring World we built in the [completed_ringworld_system.GetName] system. The construction of this great megastructure must be considered a milestone in the history of the [Root.GetName] - we have accomplished what only a handful of civilizations in the history of our galaxy has managed before.\n\nLet this Ring World stand forever as a testament to how much the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] species has achieved since we first ventured beyond the safety of our homeworld's atmosphere."

 utopia.2005.desc.a:0 "The [From.GetName] has accomplished what only a handful of civilizations in the history of our galaxy has managed before - they have finished construction of the colossal Ring World they were building around the primary star of the [completed_ringworld_system.GetName] system.\n\nThis technological marvel must be considered a testament to the impressive achievements of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] species as a whole. They have certainly come a long way from their humble beginnings."
