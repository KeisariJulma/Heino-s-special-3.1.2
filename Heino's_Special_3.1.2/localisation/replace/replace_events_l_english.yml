 observation.1025.desc:0 "Our Observation Post above [From.GetName] has been destroyed!

 observation.1027.desc:0 "The staff of our Observation Post orbiting [From.GetName] has requested help in dealing with the anti-alien task force that was founded by the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] in response to our aggressive observation efforts. Though primitive by our standards, this organization has developed a knack for disrupting our abduction operations.\n\nTheir main base has been identified on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, deep inside a mountain. Orbital bombardment will be ineffective, but a swift raid by a heavily armed strike team should be able to take the base by surprise. Its destruction will surely spell the end of this irksome [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] task force."
 observation.1028.desc:1 "Our mission to destroy the main base of the [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] supranational task force was a complete success! The base was infiltrated by our strike team, and its defenders and their primitive weapons proved no match for our skilled operatives.\n\nAfter planting explosive charges deep within the bowels of the base, the strike team exfiltrated and were picked up by waiting shuttles. Nothing remains of this troublesome [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] task force now."
 observation.1029.desc:1 "Our mission to destroy the main base of the [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] supranational task force failed miserably!

The remaining operatives met with unexpectedly stiff resistance when they eventually reached the base entrance.\n\nIn light of approaching [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] reinforcements, the strike team commander finally gave the order to retreat.

 observation.1031.desc:0 "The supranational task force that the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] nation states founded to thwart our operations on [From.GetName] has been disbanded! Though they somehow managed to achieve several victories against our shuttles and abduction teams, several of the organization's founding members decided to cut off funding and withdraw from the project.\n\nIntelligence puts this unexpected turn of events down to infighting and diplomatic posturing between the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] nation states."

 observation.2041.desc:0 "The natives on [From.GetName] have not only become enamored with our technology, but our advisors report that they are also beginning to emulate our ways.\n\nInspired by what they have seen of our art and culture, [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] society appears to have developed a new sense of egalitarianism. Their personal freedoms have greatly increased since our arrival."
 observation.2053.desc:0 "Our mission on [From.GetName] to enlighten the native civilization and advance them to the Space Age is not proceeding as planned. For some reason, the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] scientists, or what passes for such among their people, frequently become horrified when we try to teach them about new weapons technology.\n\nIt took our scientific advisors weeks to calm them after we showed a simulation illustrating the effects of detonating a fusion bomb over a populated city. This has unfortunately delayed our progress."

 observation.3002.desc:0 "Our initial infiltration cells have landed on [From.GetName], but they are having some difficulty establishing their new identities. There have been several incidents in which cell members were exposed as aliens, necessitating the immediate termination of all witnesses.\n\nThis has brought unwanted attention from [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] authorities, requiring our operatives to lay low for a while. Unfortunately, this will result in a slight delay to this phase of the operation."
 observation.3005.desc:0 "Although our operatives on the surface of [From.GetName] now number in the thousands, the progress of our operation has been slow. An infiltration cell recently attempted to overthrow the government of one of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s major nations in a violent coup, only to have the attempt foiled and most of the cell members killed.\n\nAnother cell fortunately managed to retrieve their bodies before the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] authorities could identify them as aliens, but this is a significant setback."
 observation.3007.desc:0 "All [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] leaders of significance on [From.GetName] have been replaced by our own agents.

 observation.3008.desc:0 "We have managed to replace most [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] world leaders with our own disguised agents, with a few unfortunate exceptions.

 observation.3009.desc:0 "After achieving complete dominion over the [prim_species.GetSpeciesAdj] political leadership, our infiltration cells have successfully paved the way for the arrival of our first contact unit.\n\nIn a lavish ceremony held at the new planetary capital, our diplomatic envoy graciously accepted a petition signed by every world leader on [From.GetName] calling for the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s immediate annexation into the [Root.GetName]. Jubilant citizens are crowding the streets, cheering their new alien benefactors."
 observation.3101.desc:0 "One of our covert operatives on [From.GetName] has gone rogue! The poor, misguided fool has apparently been smitten by a [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] female, and the two of them have eloped to parts unknown on the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface.\n\nWe are as yet uncertain whether our agent has revealed his true alien nature to his love interest or if he is still posing as a [From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] to her. Needless to say this is a tremendous security breach - we should do everything in our power to bring this agent back and give him the psychiatric care he is so clearly in need of."
 observation.3104.desc:0 "Any attempt to track this transmission is futile. You know me as Operative X-34. Until recently, I was a willing participant in the criminal Covert Infiltration program taking place as we speak on [From.From.GetName].\n\nNo longer. I have come to appreciate [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] culture in a way I never imagined possible, and I will not aid in its subversion.\n\nI rescind my citizenship in the [Root.GetName].

 observation.3106.desc:0 "Someone has been picking off our covert operatives on [From.GetName]. Several agents that were shadowing potential [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] acquisition targets have been found dead. While it's not impossible that the assassin or assassins came from an indigenous special forces outfit, the methods used in these takedowns indicate [Root.GetAdj] military training.\n\nThere is a high probability that these killings are the work of our rogue operative. He knows how our infiltration cells function, and he has the training to kill both efficiently and silently."
 observation.3108.desc:0 "Reports are beginning to surface from local media outlets on [From.GetName] that speak of some kind of massive global conspiracy perpetrated by aliens. The respectable [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] media has yet to touch this subject matter and much of what has been reported is pure conjecture, but there are some details that could only be known by someone with intimate knowledge of our covert operations.\n\nWe can only assume that our rogue agent has been feeding information about our infiltration program to the media. This will require some damage control."
 observation.3113.desc:1 "It is too late. The window to eliminate our rogue agent on [From.From.GetName] has passed - our intelligence sources indicate that he has relocated together with his [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] sweetheart to another safe house at an unknown location."
 observation.3133.desc:1 "With the support of the [Root.GetName] in orbit, our infiltration cells managed to avert a global nuclear war on [From.From.GetName] at the last moment. Several [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] world leaders - having been replaced by our own disguised operatives - have called for nuclear disarmament and improved international relations.\n\nWith the situation defused, the influence of our covert agents has actually been increased. This entire situation may end up working to our advantage."
