 envoy_events.15.desc:0 "[event_envoy.GetName], our envoy to the Galactic Community, has been spending a disturbing amount of time tending to a strange, small mammalian creature that began following [event_envoy.GetHerHim] around. Presumably a domestic pet that escaped from one of the other delegations, it is undeniably cute but shows no sign of sapient thought. Although it is highly carnivorous and exhibits sharp teeth and claws, it is generally affectionate and desires plentiful physical contact in the form of petting - though its mood swings can be sudden and violent!\n\nAlthough the creature has proved a distraction for [event_envoy.GetName]'s more serious tasks, other delegates have commented on the endearing nature of the softer, more sentimental side of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] psyche that has been revealed."

Do you have even the slightest notion of what your callous actions have stolen from this galaxy?"

The source seems to lie just below the [leylines_world.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, in an area rich in unusual minerals.\n\nSimilar occurrences have also been reported on worlds overseen by our colleagues in the [from.Federation.GetName]."
 leylines_chain_desc:0 "A deafening hum rings out across at least one world in our federation's space. As our colleagues work to excavate these sites, we have been asked to lend our own scientific resources to the effort."
 federations2.72.desc:0 "As [FromFrom.GetName] is no longer the center of our federation, the old plans to glorify the [FromFrom.GetPlanetMoon]'s rulers have been duly shelved."
