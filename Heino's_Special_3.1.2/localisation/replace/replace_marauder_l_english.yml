 marauder.1.desc:1 "Having decoded what counts as a language among them, [This.Owner.GetEnvoy] [This.Leader.GetName] has identified the §H[encountered_marauder.GetName]§! as a nomadic civilization known as the §H[encountered_marauder.GetRealName]§!. They occupy a number of large space stations in and around the §H[marauder_system.GetName]§! system that house the bulk of their massive numbers in crowded and squalid conditions. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, they seem to have developed a strong martial culture. Life in the cold void has become second nature to them, and they are very adept at space warfare.\n\nThere is no [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesAdj] central government to speak of. Instead, they are divided into several different factions that vie endlessly with one another for resources and respect. Given their large population and the shipbuilding capability of their stations, this constant infighting is the only thing keeping them from growing into a significant threat to galactic peace."
 marauder.3.name:0 "[From.GetName] Sighted"
 marauder.3.desc:0 "For several months now, we have received scattered reports of small numbers of alien mercenaries and privateers operating on the frontiers of our space. They call themselves the §H[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!, and are apparently exiles from a nomadic warrior culture inhabiting overcrowded space stations in and around the §H[marauder_system.GetName]§! system.\n\nTheir passage near our space proceeded without incident, but they warned us against trespassing in [marauder_system.GetName]. There is no [From.GetSpeciesAdj] central government to speak of, but their various factions are engaged in constant infighting and often launch raids against neighboring star systems. Indeed, given their vast population and space-based production capability, the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] would likely be a significant galactic power if they ever stopped killing each other."
 marauder.15.1.desc:0 "Outsiders. We are the [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Unlike the "civilized" star nations of the galaxy, we have no single master to lord over us, but I have been chosen to convey this message to you on behalf of all of the Houses:\n\nDo not try to impose your soft and effete ways upon us. You may freely send your alien ships into [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesAdj] territory, but do not expect them to return. Our warriors will welcome the diversion, however.\n\nTransmit on this frequency only if you wish to offer tribute... or if you have need of mercenaries, as well as the means to pay for them."
 marauder.15.2.desc:0 "HYEEEIIIIEEEE!!!! More dwamaks!\n\nWhat you want, foolish dwamak? What happen to make your face look like that? Reactor accident? Vacuum exposure? HYEEIIIEE!! Look at you!\n\nWe are the [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We hunt dwamak. If you come to [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesAdj] turf, we make dwamak-stew. Not good for you, yes? HYEEIIIIIEEEEE!!\n\nPerhaps you know other dwamaks. Perhaps you want them to be dwamak-stew. This can be arranged. [encountered_marauder.GetSpeciesNamePlural] not above fighting for dwamaks against other dwamaks, if price is right."
 marauder.20.1.desc_05:0 "Ah! Now here is a true fighter at last!\n\nThe martial prowess of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors is known even to us. There are thousands of [marauder_country_1.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who would dearly like to test themselves in battle against you."
 marauder.34.1.desc:0 "[marauder_country_1.GetSpeciesAdj] mercenaries are the finest in the entire galaxy. Do not let their rowdy nature deceive you - when battle is joined, their discipline is second to none. Their honor would even compel them to fight against other [marauder_country_1.GetSpeciesNamePlural], should you wish it.\n\nThese are the fleets that are currently available for hire."
 marauder.34.2.desc:0 "Even [marauder_country_2.GetSpeciesAdj] [marauder_country_2.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] can defeat bestest dwamak warriors. HYEEIIEE!!!! It is known.\n\nBut these not [marauder_country_2.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]!!! These hardened [marauder_country_2.GetSpeciesAdj] mercenaries, and they be not only dangerous, but they be DERANGED! They willing to fight for dwamaks like YOU, against other dwamaks or even [marauder_country_2.GetSpeciesNamePlural]... if you pay!\n\nHere current list of crazy [marauder_country_2.GetSpeciesAdj] fleets:"
 marauder_1_tribute:0 "[marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] Tribute"
 marauder.77.desc:0 "The rise of the [raider_khanate.GetName] under their vaunted Great Khan has triggered mass defections among all of the [raider_khanate.GetSpeciesAdj] mercenaries that were in our employ! Caught up in a sudden influx of nationalistic fervor, the traitors have all abandoned their contracts and left to join the Great Khan's growing war machine."
 marauder.86.a.desc:0 "Attention, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nIf you have need of others to fight your battles for you, know that [marauder_mercenary_country.GetSpeciesAdj] mercenary fleets are now available for hire. Yes, you heard correctly. If you can meet their prices, the best mercenaries in the galaxy are now willing to fight for you."
 marauder.101.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] weaklings, our warriors are on their way to plunder your systems. Face them in battle if you can muster the courage, or cower in fear until they have had their fill of your riches.\n\nYou can, of course, offer tribute now to spare yourselves from the coming onslaught. If it is sufficient, our warriors may be compelled to turn back..."
 marauder.104.desc:0 "[marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] raiding parties have made planetfall on §H[Root.GetName]§!! Deploying in small attack shuttles from their orbiting fleet, the [marauder_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] hit several outlying settlements on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] before retreating back into space with their plunder. Our defensive forces on the surface had no time to respond."
 marauder.105.desc:0 "[marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] slavers have landed on §H[Root.GetName]§!! Attack shuttles hit several outlying settlements on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon], rounding up colonists and transporting them back in chains to the raiders' orbiting fleet."
 marauder.106.desc:0 "Light [marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] forces have conducted a hit-and-run attack on §H[Root.GetName]§!. Their dispersed landings confused the tactical response units leading our surface forces, and before they could react the raiders had already returned to orbit with whatever spoils they could gather from our settlements."
 marauder.107.desc:0 "[marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] slavers have landed on §H[Root.GetName]§!! Bombing runs from their attack shuttles cracked open several of our organic sanctuaries, which were then stormed by heavily armed raiding parties.\n\nThe bewildered organics who had, until now, been kept safe within these sanctuaries were promptly rounded up by the slavers and returned in chains to their orbiting fleet."
 marauder.108.desc:0 "[marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] raiding parties have made planetfall on §H[Root.GetName]§!! The raiders plundered several of our outposts on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] and slaughtered hundreds of drones before they retreated back to their orbiting fleet."
 marauder.114.desc:0 "The heavy damage inflicted upon the [marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj] raiding fleet has been enough to give pause to their warriors. After reconsidering their options, the [marauder_country.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have apparently decided to abandon their raid and withdraw back to their own space."
 marauder.116.desc:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesAdj] fleet that vowed to raid our space has been destroyed as the result of a fleet action in the [destroyed_fleet_system.GetName] system. No survivors have been reported found amongst the debris."
 marauder.117.desc:0 "The §H[marauder_country.GetSpeciesAdj]§! marauders that we "encouraged" to launch a raid against the §H[marauder_target.GetName]§! have turned tail and are running back to their own space! The losses sustained by their raiding fleet were apparently grave enough to give them a change of heart."
 marauder.120.name:0 "Incoming [raiding_marauder.GetSpeciesAdj] Raid"
 marauder.120.desc:0 "A §H[raiding_marauder.GetSpeciesAdj]§! raiding fleet has been detected approaching our borders! Intercepted communications indicate that they have been hired by a rivalling foreign power to attack our systems. They are transmitting a message directed towards us on an open channel."
 marauder.121.1.desc:0 "Cowards huddling in darkness have asked us to face you, since they are too afraid to do so themselves. Are there any [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors honorable enough to meet us in open battle, then, or must we plunder your systems unopposed? Show us your worth!"
 marauder.122.name:0 "[raid_parent.GetSpeciesAdj] Raiders Withdraw"
 marauder.124.name:0 "[raiding_marauder.GetSpeciesAdj] Raiding Fleet Destroyed"
 marauder.501.desc:0 "For the first time in recorded history, the warring factions of the §H[raider_khanate.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! have united under a single §HGreat Khan§!. This mysterious warlord, who according to some accounts is a powerful psychic, has emerged from their warrior caste and accomplished what most thought impossible. Through a combination of guile, charisma and military genius, the newly crowned Great Khan has won the utter loyalty and devotion of all [raider_khanate.GetSpeciesAdj] factions.\n\nNow that they are no longer busy killing each other, the [raider_khanate.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are turning their attention elsewhere. Great fleets are massing for war, crewed by eager warriors who are now steadfast comrades in arms despite having been mortal enemies mere months ago."
 marauder.502.desc:0 "I am §H[raider_khanate.Ruler.GetName]§!, Great Khan of the §H[raider_khanate.GetName]§!, and I am here to announce to the galaxy that a new age is upon us. The dark era where [raider_khanate.GetSpeciesNamePlural] would senselessly butcher one another for scraps of resources or a misguided sense of honor has finally come to an end.\n\nI have solemnly promised my people a new beginning through the formation of a great empire that will forever enshrine the name of the [raider_khanate.GetSpeciesAdj] species in the annals of galactic history.\n\nTo those who would stand in our way, know this: I will stop at nothing to realize the true destiny of my people. If you oppose us, the [raider_khanate.GetName] will grind you into dust."
 marauder.504.desc:0 "After defeating the brave defenders of §H[conquered_planet.GetName]§!, ground forces from the [From.GetName] have claimed the [conquered_planet.GetPlanetMoon] in the name of their Great Khan! They have raised the banner of their new empire over every major settlement on the [conquered_planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface. Even now, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] colonists are being ferried in from their decaying space habitats."
 marauder.526.desc:0 "The recent destruction of one of their large void dwellings at the hands of the §H[awakened_horde.GetName]§! has prompted the §H[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! to unite under a single Great Khan for the first time in history. This mysterious warlord, who according to some accounts is a powerful psychic, has convinced the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to put aside their differences for the sake of continued survival.\n\nGreat war fleets from previously hidden anchorages are being crewed by eager [From.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors and restored into working order. Under the inspired leadership of their Great Khan, they now demand vengeance from the galaxy for their lost kin."
 marauder.550.h.desc:0 "I weep for those who fall before my forces, but there is no other way if the [raider_khanate.GetSpeciesAdj] people are to have a future."
 marauder.550.k.desc:0 "You speak to me on behalf of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] Satrapy, yes? The... [Root.GetName], I believe. What can your Great Khan do for you?"
 marauder.550.n.desc:0 "Is this the [Root.GetAdj] central consciousness that I am addressing, then? Fascinating."
 marauder.550.o.desc:0 "I understand that [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] drones obey the commands of their Hive Mind without question. As long as your Hive Mind serves me in a similar fashion, we shall have no problems."
 marauder.550.p.desc:0 "You were wise to submit to my rule. This decision saved countless [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] lives."
 marauder.550.a.2.response:0 "Do you think I am fool enough to trust [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] lies a second time? No, this time the fight is to the end. You have forfeited your right to exist in the new galactic order I am building."
 marauder.550.b.response:0 "Ah, yes. You are perhaps referring to the somewhat crude and... shall we say, rustic dialect that has been used by [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] up until now.\n\nYou may not believe this, but the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] language was once far more developed. It is only in the last thousand years or so that it has gradually devolved into its current sorry state.\n\nBut that changes now. Henceforth, all [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] will be educated in the older, richer version of our language. There shall be no more shrieking."
 marauder.550.c.response:0 "Superstitious beliefs and religious dogma have brought nothing but ruin to the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people. Those who wish to continue in their worship of She of the Void, or any other spiritual symbol for that matter, are free to do so, but it is no longer mandatory.\n\nI mean to bring about a new age of science and progress for [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and, indeed, for the whole of the galaxy. Narrow-minded zealots have no place in the future I am building."
 marauder.551.a.response:0 "You may now consider yourselves loyal servants of the Great Khan of the [raider_khanate.GetName]. With the signing of this accord, countless [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] lives have been saved. This is a great day for the [Root.GetName].\n\nOnce my conquest of the galaxy has been completed, we shall see about revising the Satrapy system and perhaps integrating your realm more closely into my empire. Until then, I leave you to rule yourselves."
 marauder.620.desc:0 "The death of the §HGreat Khan§! has proved the undoing of the §H[From.GetName]§!. Without a strong ruler to unite them, the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have succumbed to infighting once more. Their empire has been divided between the §HDiadochi§!, the most powerful and influential of the Great Khan's military commanders.\n\nEach of them now claims the title of Great Khan of the Galaxy, and their supporters are locked in bitter opposition to one another. The time of a united [From.GetSpeciesAdj] empire is apparently at an end."
 marauder.640.desc:0 "Against all odds, the §H[From.GetSpeciesAdj] Horde§! has managed to weather the turmoil that followed in the wake of the death of the §HGreat Khan§!. The immediate threat of splintering into different successor states has been largely eliminated with the coronation of a new khan.\n\nFor now, this reborn [From.GetSpeciesAdj] Khanate seems more concerned with the consolidation of the territory it already controls than making new conquests."
