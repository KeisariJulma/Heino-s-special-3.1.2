# Meritocracy
 
MERIT_TO_NON_01_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "It is painfully obvious now that your [From.GetRulerTitle] gained [From.Leader.GetHerHis] office through political cloak-and-dagger, if not random fortune, rather than any ability to govern."
MERIT_TO_NON_01_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "In the [Root.GetAdj] meritocracy, only the best and brightest [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are considered for important government postings. Is it not the same on [From.Capital.GetName]? How did [From.GetRulerName] become your [From.GetRulerTitle]?"
